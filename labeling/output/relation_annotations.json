For one night extended for an entire day, and for one day extended for two.\nLast month I had to go again to the post for renew my pills and I told another medical girl about my pain and how it was and she put me in a suspicion list of endometriosis and she told me that I had to do magnetic resonance.\nI was really scared and I searched comfort and I found this subreddit and I identified with a lot of posts of going nights crying because of pain, losing all of strength, vomiting and others aches and I've found comfort in that and I thought it was all gonna be okay.\nThen today I took the result and I was nothing, it's all normal \nI CANT understand this how the fuck is this normal??\nAll those fucking nights \nAll those days I lose tests in my school \nAll those days my mother and my father stayed with me through the night trying to comfort me of my pain, saying that it was going to end soon. All my fucking fear of passing out in the street when my period was coming and I was in the school IS FUCKING NOTHING?\nI don't want to take contraceptive pills in a continuously way till menopause because it raises the chance to get breast cancer and I don't want that.\nI just don't know what to do anymore.\nI can't do lap to confirm because it's expensive as hell where I live I would have to work for years to even dream to do that, and in the position I am I have to accumulate money for other things first.\nSorry for the long long rant i just can't rant to other people than this subreddit and my bf \nMy mother when I was in a suspicion list and was scared she just ignored me and I'm not surprised about that\nMy father won't get it, he will feel relief and I understand, but it won't solve my problem and he will stop to care about this\nMy boyfriend and this sub were the only ones that gave me courage but now i don't belong here anymore.\nI hope all those pains that all of you suffer vanish soon\nThanks for all","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/licec1/my_worst_fear_came_true/","_input_hash":1579503715,"_task_hash":359491959,"options":[{"id":"FAMILY","text":"FAMILY"},{"id":"FRIEND","text":"FRIEND"},{"id":"PARTNER","text":"PARTNER"},{"id":"THERAPIST","text":"THERAPIST"},{"id":"DOCTORS","text":"DOCTORS"},{"id":"ENDO SUPPORT COMMUNITY","text":"ENDO SUPPORT COMMUNITY"},{"id":"NON-ENDO-AUTHOR","text":"NON-ENDO-AUTHOR"},{"id":"OTHER","text":"OTHER"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"choice","accept":["DOCTORS","ENDO SUPPORT COMMUNITY","FAMILY","PARTNER"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept"}

{"id":"Endo_puap3c_0","text":"Recently, I went to the gyno for extended period cramping (about 5-6 days after period, cramping only). After an ultrasound they discovered 2 cysts which they believe are endometriomas in and on left ovary. After six weeks they followed it up with a second ultra sound that showed left ovary now has 3 cysts and they have increased in size (largest is 7 plus cm). The gyno recommended surgery to remove cysts on left ovary only. I am very concerned about the c-word since my CA 125 was 90 during ovulation and 150 during period so I wanted whole ovary removed. We compromised and she put me on bc combo pills without a break to see if the CA 125 would come down prior to surgery. Two weeks into bc pills, my period arrived 5 days late but the cramps  have been horrible for two days now even with taking Advils and Tylenol (feels as if I am taking nothing). Also, sometimes I get weird burning sensation in my left area where I assume cysts are located. I am not sure what to do (I have messaged the doctor) but I am freaking out a bit.

I have been told by my gyno that they believe I do have endo, as I have a family history and we have ruled out everything else. I have not had a laparoscopy yet because it is extremely difficult for me to receive one in my state, but I am working on trying to get one out of state for the upcoming year. With that all out of the way, I am on low dose estrogen birth control pill and have found that I get extremely bloated the week before my period is about to start. I also have pregnancy anxiety and convince myself that I\u2019m pregnant during this week and makes me freak out. I\u2019m getting really frustrated because 1. The bloating SUCKS 2. It causes me terrible terrible anxiety attacks 3. I feel helpless Bc I can\u2019t get a lap and I want to quit BCP but don\u2019t know if I can because of my pain. Any advice would help!!

The orilissa is still new for me, but my period just started today and I do admit my period has decreased in pain already. Normally I would be curled up in bed crying, but although there is pain it's not overbearing. The only problem with orilissa is I can only take it for a year max before it starts impacting me, and she told me that if the dosage ever needs to increase then that time is shortened. So it's like.... I will just end up back where I started basically? My doctor has basically been against the surgery. She said she really doesn't like to put her patients through surgery because she has found that a lot of them come back because the endometriosis has reoccurred or come back because the surgery didn't work at all. She also mentioned that is a number of risks with any surgery, and that surgery is not a cure for endometriosis just another management so she rather not approve the surgery just for me to end up with endo again in 5 years while also gaining another potential problem from the risks. It is just really hard because I am tired of having all these issues. I already had Hashimoto's disease before this which impacts my life on and off, but at least Hashimoto's didn't cause me enormous amounts of pain like Endo does. Before anyone asks since I wasn't diagnosed through surgery. Yes, she checked for everything else. I have had every test imaginable that could explain my symptoms. Endometriosis was all that was left because everything else came back normal. I'm sorry I am just really overwhelmed recently because not only am I dealing with endometriosis but my thyroid levels are out of wack too.

It probably doesn\u2019t make sense to most people but it does for me. The pain feels terrible and sometimes it\u2019s everywhere including my upper abdomen(below my ribs), my sides , chest and this pain and suffocating feel in my neck that radiates to my head. Migraines too for hours that makes me unable to fall asleep. I have constant back pain although the intensity varies but it\u2019s usually bad and sometimes I can\u2019t even sit down. It radiates down my legs sometimes to my feet too. Painkillers does nearly nothing for it. And the chronic pelvic pain too that feels like a deep migraine and sometimes stabbing pains. It\u2019s worse on my right side. Thigh pains too and it hurts to touch. The painful bloating and malaise. Chronic fatigue and insomnia. My joints and muscle hurt most of the time. Pain in my right arm when it gets really bad. At this point if there\u2019s any trigger I have no idea what it is. Stress is the only thing I know for sure. And this isn\u2019t even on my period. I get cramps days before and when it finally starts it\u2019s the worst thing ever and gets worse if I do something stressful. Intense cramping plus everything I mentioned above and there\u2019s this pain in my throat like I have a wound but it goes away 3-4 days later. The pain on my period wakes me up if I\u2019m sleeping and I can\u2019t go back until I\u2019ve taking about 75-100mg diclofenac and it only reduces the pain for a few hours. I can\u2019t even describe what it feels like but I\u2019ve never passed out or thrown up so sometimes I wonder if it really is that bad. I don\u2019t know. I also have digestive issues and PUD on top of all this. I\u2019m constantly in some sort of pain constantly which varies from bearable to absolutely horrible. I should also mention that I tried birth control but it only helped with my period cramps and my first period after I started was the worst I ever had at the time. \nIf you made it this far I just want to say thank you.

Semi recently within the last few years I\u2019ve been put on several different continuous BC pills to stop having periods. Recently I\u2019ve started having a problem where I have breakthrough bleeding every month or so and it continues as long as I keep on the pill and only stops when I come off (my record was 3 weeks straight) But it happens so frequently I can barely get a month in without breakthrough bleeding. I\u2019m going in to the gyno Tuesday for possibly an ultrasound. This will be my first \u201ctest\u201d regarding endo since it\u2019s just been assumed with no official diagnosis. What can I do to make sure I\u2019m doing the right thing? Are there questions I should be asking or medications or procedures I should be advocating for?

I mentioned that I found him through the Nook, and he made an offhand comment that sounded like he disapproved because people \"become convinced they have endo on there.\" He said I didn't exhibit classic symptoms of endo, and because I didn't \"react\" the way apparently most of his patients do to his pelvic exam, he was very doubtful that I had it. He made no other suggestions for what could be going on with my pelvic area. I became slightly emotional after he left the room because of how poorly the appointment was going. When he came back in, he kept asking if I had a history of depression and whether I was depressed. Despite me saying I was doing pretty well, he kept insisting I see a psychiatrist.

I was diagnosed with Endometriosis on the 11th of February, it was found on my Uterosacral Ligaments and Scarring (adhesions I'm guessing) was seen on my POD. This was treated with Helica. Initially I felt great. Flare ups were few and far between, I felt as though things had maybe improved. However, I'm now getting more and more frequent pelvic pain reappearing, particularly sharp stabbing pain on my left hand side. Really really bad shooting pain down my legs and hips. I'm worried about this as I have a Neurological condition which can effect my ability to walk and makes my legs numb at times, so I'm extremely worried about this. I did get Leg pain before the operation, but this seems to be more frequent now. Could this be that there's some Endo on my nerves that were missed? My bladder is atrocious, I can't stop going to the loo. It's very sore, and I'm getting awful back pain.

{"id":"Endo_juvzai_0","text":"VERY LONG POST SORRY. Hi all. I did have another account on here but I can't get logged in so I created a new one ages ago.\nBrief history- was diagnosed in February this year with Endo, after 10+ years of symptoms. I'm 26. I'm from Scotland, UK. It was found on my Uterosacral Ligaments, POD and elsewhere (can post exact details in comments). I did have an MRI in August last year that indicated bowel and bladder involvement and organs fused together, adhesions, thickening etc. None of this was picked up on the Laparoscopy. It was done by a general Gynaecologist and not a specialist. It was treated with Helica (ablation), not excision. I was due a follow up with my own consultant in August (he didn't even do the damn surgery), but then it was cancelled due to Covid. My symptoms improved for a few months but now I'm back to square one again and I feel absolutely fucking awful. My symptoms are terrible, 100x worse. I've since saught the advice off a private Gynaecologist in Glasgow who also works the NHS, he works at the Endometriosis centre in Glasgow. I had a telephone consultation with him in June. He suggested Decapeptyl injections once a month for 3 months, then a 3 monthly one. Fast forward to now and my symptoms are not improving, even on the Decapeptyl. I went to see him face to face on the 9th of this month. I explained all the above. He said that I should get the 3 month injection as I may see a difference after the full 6 months of treatment. I however disagree, he thinks it's my periods that need to stop and that's why I'm not getting much relief (I had a breakthrough bleed a few weeks ago as I'm late getting my 3 month injection). I did explain that I have all the classic Endo symptoms out with my period too. I was on the Depo injection for 4 years and it stopped my periods altogether, but I still had horrific symptoms. \nDespite him recommending another injection, he said I need a referral to the Endometriosis centre. He said he suspects I have Deep infiltrating disease that needs treating with Excision. He said the Helica treatment and the injections have proved ineffective and incomplete, and due to possible/suspected bowel and bladder involvement I qualify for Referral. I am outside the health board area of the centre, so I need to get my own consultant to reffer me. The private Gynaecologist is writing to my GP with the above concerns. \nMy issue/concern is this. I finally have my follow up appointment with my own consultant tomorrow. It is a telephone consultation. I am extremely nervous/worried he will dismiss me and reffer to refuse me. I had a Laparoscopy in March last year where nothing was found, he then told me before I I managed to persuade him to do an MRI 'I doubt they'll find anything on the MRI, and they won't have missed anything on your Laparoscopy'. That is what I am dealing with.\nPlease please if anyone has any advice on how to approach my consultant regarding all this, I would so appreciate it.\nMy quality of life is so so terrible atm and I'm so worried I've been let down again and will continue to be if I don't get the right treatment. \nThanks for reading, I apologise for the length. \nXx","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/juvzai/follow_up_appointment_feeling_really_nervous/","_input_hash":982513342,"_task_hash":1076704525,"options":[{"id":"FAMILY","text":"FAMILY"},{"id":"FRIEND","text":"FRIEND"},{"id":"PARTNER","text":"PARTNER"},{"id":"THERAPIST","text":"THERAPIST"},{"id":"DOCTORS","text":"DOCTORS"},{"id":"ENDO SUPPORT COMMUNITY","text":"ENDO SUPPORT COMMUNITY"},{"id":"NON-ENDO-AUTHOR","text":"NON-ENDO-AUTHOR"},{"id":"OTHER","text":"OTHER"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"choice","accept":["DOCTORS"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept"}

{"id":"Endo_jbf1b7_0","text":"I am 16 (17 next month). My therapist told me to join support groups to cope with my life being flipped on its head. I got diagnosed with Endo in July. I had symptoms a year prior and never had a normal cycle. At the end of March my pain and bloating became so bad that I was bed resting. I had a doctor blow me off when I brought up my bloating and pain documenting pictures of every time I would blow up. I looked like my mother when she was pregnant with me (about 7 or 8 months). \nMy mother has decided Endo but only found out this year. Her PCOS masked the Endo pretty well   After a few months of excessive pain my mom took me to the doctor that diagnosed her and did her surgery. I had an exam and cried from the pain, and next day I had an ultrasound that showed nothing. I made the choice to have a lap and a D&amp;C. A week before surgery I had a kidney infection, caused by all the swelling shutting my urethra and prevent me from using the restroom. I went to the ER with a fever of 105. It cleared up with antibiotics. \nSurgery went well. My nerve pain was very bad, so my doctor cut my uterine nerve. I healed great with beautiful scarring. I wasn\u2019t in too much pain after (or I was so relieved). \nFast forward to today. I have a implant and I take estrogen. My bladder is too week so I have bad incontinence. I am going back to my other doctor in a few weeks (the one that blew me off) and my mental state is horrible. I can\u2019t do the one school activity I love. I\u2019m exhausted of being like this so early on. I\u2019m tired of putting on a face and joking about being pregnant looking when I know that\u2019s one of my life goals now made harder.\nThe only good thing I got is my love for medicine and my goals to help people just like us is giving me enough fire to keep working to get into nursing school and continue with my nursing assistant program now. \nSo, how do y\u2019all do it?

Since 2018 my bowels have been MESSED up, constant pain while moving a bowel I mean I am in tears gripping whatever I can. Sex hurts again near the back end.
