Flash forward: I still have been experiencing the heavy periods and awful cramps and pain in between and I pretty much just accepted defeat loll. But around three months ago I was taking a shower and had the most sudden, sharp, debilitating pain in my lower abdomen I would say. It was so bad I immediately dropped to the floor and sat there for like 10-15 minutes in pain it hurt so bad I could barely move.I didn’t even finish showering but eventually it died down and I just left it at that. Honestly I was just in shock that something so painful occurred. I never got checked out to see what happened, I honestly thought maybe it was endo acting up again. I’m wondering, was that a ruptured cyst or something? I’ve experienced a lot of pain around there in my life but nothing was as bad as that. I truly thought I was going to die in that moment…and I regret not going to the doctors. Ever since June though, I’ve had a lot of bleeding almost every single day, with the patch on. I’m going to get checked soon hopefully but has anyone experienced this?

27,Endo_licec1_0,"To begin, sorry for the bad english, I'm Brazilian and it's not my first language as you can see
It all happened when I was 14/15 years old, I woke up in pain and my period just started, i vomited all over and I couldn't sleep because of the pain, when the sun raise and I had to go to school I was not capable because it hurt so much that I couldn't walk.
Gone to a medical post (we call it here clínica da família I don't know if in other places there is something like that) and I talked to gynecologist about it and she recommended me contrapcevative pills and I accepted it.
It worked for the first months then it all happened again, and this time worse, I tried to endure it for the most I could but the pain just grow stronger and stronger. For one night extended for an entire day, and for one day extended for two.
Last month I had to go again to the post for renew my pills and I told another medical girl about my pain and how it was and she put me in a suspicion list of endometriosis and she told me that I had to do magnetic resonance.
I was really scared and I searched comfort and I found this subreddit and I identified with a lot of posts of going nights crying because of pain, losing all of strength, vomiting and others aches and I've found comfort in that and I thought it was all gonna be okay.
Then today I took the result and I was nothing, it's all normal 
I CANT understand this how the fuck is this normal??
All those fucking nights 
All those days I lose tests in my school 
All those days my mother and my father stayed with me through the night trying to comfort me of my pain, saying that it was going to end soon. All my fucking fear of passing out in the street when my period was coming and I was in the school IS FUCKING NOTHING?
I don't want to take contraceptive pills in a continuously way till menopause because it raises the chance to get breast cancer and I don't want that.
I just don't know what to do anymore.
I can't do lap to confirm because it's expensive as hell where I live I would have to work for years to even dream to do that, and in the position I am I have to accumulate money for other things first.
Sorry for the long long rant i just can't rant to other people than this subreddit and my bf 
My mother when I was in a suspicion list and was scared she just ignored me and I'm not surprised about that
My father won't get it, he will feel relief and I understand, but it won't solve my problem and he will stop to care about this
My boyfriend and this sub were the only ones that gave me courage but now i don't belong here anymore.

After an ultrasound they discovered 2 cysts which they believe are endometriomas in and on left ovary. After six weeks they followed it up with a second ultra sound that showed left ovary now has 3 cysts and they have increased in size (largest is 7 plus cm). The gyno recommended surgery to remove cysts on left ovary only. I am very concerned about the c-word since my CA 125 was 90 during ovulation and 150 during period so I wanted whole ovary removed. We compromised and she put me on bc combo pills without a break to see if the CA 125 would come down prior to surgery. Two weeks into bc pills, my period arrived 5 days late but the cramps  have been horrible for two days now even with taking Advils and Tylenol (feels as if I am taking nothing). Also, sometimes I get weird burning sensation in my left area where I assume cysts are located. I am not sure what to do (I have messaged the doctor) but I am freaking out a bit.

Have you disclosed your endometriosis to your employer?

My second job is for a school- I'm on a temporary contract and it will come to an end on June 25th.

Should I disclose that I have endometriosis as my pre existing condition? There is only 3 weeks left on my contract but if this pain keeps up, I think I'll need to take a day or two off just to rest.

She told me I needed an mri to be sure but from what I’ve seen here that isn’t 100% sure to give a diagnosis. I don’t have insurance so she just told me there wasn’t much she could do until I have coverage. Heather hasn’t helped to manage my pain.

It radiates down my legs sometimes to my feet too. Painkillers does nearly nothing for it. And the chronic pelvic pain too that feels like a deep migraine and sometimes stabbing pains. It’s worse on my right side. Thigh pains too and it hurts to touch. The painful bloating and malaise. Chronic fatigue and insomnia. My joints and muscle hurt most of the time. Pain in my right arm when it gets really bad. At this point if there’s any trigger I have no idea what it is. Stress is the only thing I know for sure. And this isn’t even on my period. I get cramps days before and when it finally starts it’s the worst thing ever and gets worse if I do something stressful. Intense cramping plus everything I mentioned above and there’s this pain in my throat like I have a wound but it goes away 3-4 days later. The pain on my period wakes me up if I’m sleeping and I can’t go back until I’ve taking about 75-100mg diclofenac and it only reduces the pain for a few hours. I can’t even describe what it feels like but I’ve never passed out or thrown up so sometimes I wonder if it really is that bad. I don’t know. I also have digestive issues and PUD on top of all this. I’m constantly in some sort of pain constantly which varies from bearable to absolutely horrible. I should also mention that I tried birth control but it only helped with my period cramps and my first period after I started was the worst I ever had at the time.

414,Endo_juvzai_0,"VERY LONG POST SORRY. Hi all. I did have another account on here but I can't get logged in so I created a new one ages ago.
Brief history- was diagnosed in February this year with Endo, after 10+ years of symptoms. I'm 26. I'm from Scotland, UK. It was found on my Uterosacral Ligaments, POD and elsewhere (can post exact details in comments). I did have an MRI in August last year that indicated bowel and bladder involvement and organs fused together, adhesions, thickening etc. None of this was picked up on the Laparoscopy. It was done by a general Gynaecologist and not a specialist. It was treated with Helica (ablation), not excision. I was due a follow up with my own consultant in August (he didn't even do the damn surgery), but then it was cancelled due to Covid. My symptoms improved for a few months but now I'm back to square one again and I feel absolutely fucking awful. My symptoms are terrible, 100x worse. I've since saught the advice off a private Gynaecologist in Glasgow who also works the NHS, he works at the Endometriosis centre in Glasgow. I had a telephone consultation with him in June. He suggested Decapeptyl injections once a month for 3 months, then a 3 monthly one. Fast forward to now and my symptoms are not improving, even on the Decapeptyl. I went to see him face to face on the 9th of this month. I explained all the above. He said that I should get the 3 month injection as I may see a difference after the full 6 months of treatment. I however disagree, he thinks it's my periods that need to stop and that's why I'm not getting much relief (I had a breakthrough bleed a few weeks ago as I'm late getting my 3 month injection). I did explain that I have all the classic Endo symptoms out with my period too. I was on the Depo injection for 4 years and it stopped my periods altogether, but I still had horrific symptoms. 
Despite him recommending another injection, he said I need a referral to the Endometriosis centre. He said he suspects I have Deep infiltrating disease that needs treating with Excision. He said the Helica treatment and the injections have proved ineffective and incomplete, and due to possible/suspected bowel and bladder involvement I qualify for Referral. I am outside the health board area of the centre, so I need to get my own consultant to reffer me. The private Gynaecologist is writing to my GP with the above concerns. 
My issue/concern is this. I finally have my follow up appointment with my own consultant tomorrow. It is a telephone consultation. I am extremely nervous/worried he will dismiss me and reffer to refuse me. I had a Laparoscopy in March last year where nothing was found, he then told me before I I managed to persuade him to do an MRI 'I doubt they'll find anything on the MRI, and they won't have missed anything on your Laparoscopy'. That is what I am dealing with.
Please please if anyone has any advice on how to approach my consultant regarding all this, I would so appreciate it.
My quality of life is so so terrible atm and I'm so worried I've been let down again and will continue to be if I don't get the right treatment.

482,endometriosis_g9ekoh_0,My doctor told me to message her today to ask her how I was feeling. She prescribed me meloxicam after naproxen didn’t work. Shocker! The meloxicam didn’t touch my pain either. I told her that and she pretty much told me that’s impossible. She gives people that who have arthritis and it works great for them. Told me if it’s not working to just take regular ibuprofen along with Tylenol. I’m tired of taking pills every 6 hours in hopes that I will feel some relief. It’s really starting to mess with my stomach. She referred me to an OBGYN so I’m hopeful that this new person will actually believe me and understand how much pain I’m in. She also told me she would write a prescription for lidocaine patches but they are spendy and insurance doesn’t pay. So that’s a no go. I’m not gonna pay for something that might not work. 😢 luckily this last weekend was the worst pain from my period.

484,Endo_jbf1b7_0,"I am 16 (17 next month). My therapist told me to join support groups to cope with my life being flipped on its head. I got diagnosed with Endo in July. I had symptoms a year prior and never had a normal cycle. At the end of March my pain and bloating became so bad that I was bed resting. I had a doctor blow me off when I brought up my bloating and pain documenting pictures of every time I would blow up. I looked like my mother when she was pregnant with me (about 7 or 8 months). 
My mother has decided Endo but only found out this year. Her PCOS masked the Endo pretty well   After a few months of excessive pain my mom took me to the doctor that diagnosed her and did her surgery. I had an exam and cried from the pain, and next day I had an ultrasound that showed nothing. I made the choice to have a lap and a D&amp;C. A week before surgery I had a kidney infection, caused by all the swelling shutting my urethra and prevent me from using the restroom. I went to the ER with a fever of 105. It cleared up with antibiotics. 
Surgery went well. My nerve pain was very bad, so my doctor cut my uterine nerve. I healed great with beautiful scarring. I wasn’t in too much pain after (or I was so relieved). 
Fast forward to today. I have a implant and I take estrogen. My bladder is too week so I have bad incontinence. I am going back to my other doctor in a few weeks (the one that blew me off) and my mental state is horrible. I can’t do the one school activity I love. I’m exhausted of being like this so early on. I’m tired of putting on a face and joking about being pregnant looking when I know that’s one of my life goals now made harder.
The only good thing I got is my love for medicine and my goals to help people just like us is giving me enough fire to keep working to get into nursing school and continue with my nursing assistant program now. 
So, how do y’all do it? I need to know how to make the best of this.

The pain is not just during sex, but random times and I’ve been bloating a lot. I check “some” of the boxes for endo but not all so my dr is trying to rule out other stomach issues. I’ve seen two diff gyns and they just tell me this is normal because I’ve had two babies and send me to pelvic floor therapy. I’ve also had two pelvic US in the last year and a CT scan. My primary dr actually listens to me and wants to help so he’s referred me to another gyn he knows. I don’t mind going to physical therapy (although from what I’ve heard it’s a joke) if my dr will give me a follow up plan. It’s as if my pain has just been dismissed over and over again and is normalized. I dont want to accept that. 
I just see a lot of associated horrible period pains with endo and I’m curious if anyone has had this and not had that symptom I guess.

I've always had extremely heavy and highly irregular periods since I started menstruating, to the point that even the period tracker apps couldn't help. I would miss at least one day of work and/or school a month due to cramps, nausea, vomiting, etc. 
At age 15 I began getting a ripping, burning pain around my left hip sometimes when I stood up, and that has only worsened, so now it's hip to hip and usually brings me to my knees. There's no set pattern to it, sometimes it happens twice a day, sometimes once every 2 weeks, sometimes once every month or so. But it's now gotten so bad that I immediately start bleeding for over 15 days when it happens.
I've been on birth control for the last 5 years, and while that's definitely helped with the horrendous periods, whatever is wrong is getting worse.
I also have pain during sex, but it's not overwhelming and I rarely have to stop sex. I do, however, have painful cramping during arousal that will vary in intensity and length.

well as of now, my symptoms have gotten even worse lately. i haven’t gotten my period in 2 months but it feels like the day before my period of that makes sense. like i get cramps in my uterus area and ovaries and lower back and stomach but no period. it’s a dull pain but it’s hard to move. so that on top of the random episodes of the extreme cramps (which have spread further into the vaginal canal and up to where my uterus is) is kind of what’s going on for me right now. i can never find an actual article or anything online that matches up what i’m going through but whenever i google the symptoms endometriosis is the first thing to pop up and a lot of the symptoms matched. i also found out that my aunt has it so that would make sense.

For the longest time it was a spiralling thought process which sometimes I could control quite well (other times not). Now though it seems to be more of a physical thing?? I start shaking and feeling really sick and my vision goes weird and blurry, which in itself is pretty terrifying. So I'll get to my point cuz I know this is a massive boring ramble- I'm not sure whether to bring it up at my next appointment.

I sometimes experience abdominal pain during ovulation. Also I tend to have diarrhoea at least once a day on the days leading up to my period and also during.

It normally passes after 2-5 minutes and then I feel fine again. I’ve also been experiencing pain during sex which is very uncomfortable and I have noticed some blood afterwards on toilet paper after wiping (very light, light pink in colour).

I had another loss in 2012 2 weeks before my father in law passed away. We had moved twice and I had very bad doctors. Basically they wanted me to do depo again and I refused. He my doctor in my new state said I will not give you birth control because after that last loss of pregnancy you can't get pregnant again it's not possible. So I suffered with heavy periods mood swings and cysts that would burst-rarely did I complain. Moved to my current state in 2013 got really sick for a month straight went to my primary care doctor did a pregnancy test told me I was pregnant. This was almost a year and a half after my doctor in another state said it wasn't possible. Had an amazing ob/gyn delivered my girl in July 2014. He told me immediately to get on birth control he knew I didn't want more kids. I did and I finally got relief-most days. Still have cysts last one landed me in the emergency room because I was more pain than even my labor pain! By this point I have a new doc my pregnancy doc moved on. This guy is a supposed specialist but he's like all we can do is birth control-possibly surgery. I can't do surgery again it didn't work the last time. I refuse to do depo. I finally got my weight down from almost 240 to 190. On bad days though I retain 20 pounds of fluid so I looove the looks like I'm a fatty who can't control herself when she goes out to eat-I portion control to keep my weight in check.

I'm tired of fighting doctors we moved for work not because we had wanderlust. All my doctors look over my history and are floored how sick I truly am inside it's stage 4 I grow cysts all the time the big ones cause the most pain. The only good thing is my husband-he's gone through it all with me. He has held me after surgery, our losses the infertility diagnosis, our daughter.

Of course, I've been googling treatments and everything else surrounding endo. I've been scared to go to the gyno about this even before I googled it. I've seen all the crap my mom has gone through while dealing with this. I'm going to a new gyno because I moved and I loved my old one. I currently use Skyla...the string is not visible on a vag exam, it hurt like hell to get placed, and I'm not looking forward to getting it removed sooner. As a person with mental health problems (mostly due to an abusive childhood), I've gone through medication and therapies for about 4 years before I found something that works and I suffered for 4 years before I even had the freedom to access treatments.

I wake a lot during the night which is a sign of apnea.  You can get a sleep study through your gp just if anyone has ever said you snore.  (Or if you test high on the self assesments.) There are self assesments you can take to further identify if you think you should be tested.  I am absolutely horrified how bad mine is.  No wonder I never feel good.

63,Endo_3sfw10_0,"So here I sit in my hospital bed, I've just drank my first sachet of Picolax and now I wait.....
I've been told my surgery should be in the morning, I'm the only person my consultant will be operating on so hopefully there won't be any delays. Upon admission the nurse said all yesterday's surgeries had to be cancelled because there was no beds so I am eternally grateful to be laying here this evening.
My last excision surgery was performed less that a year ago on Dec 22nd. As I lay here this eve I can't help but think of how different I felt only 11 months ago. Before my surgery last year I was completely incapacitated: I couldn't walk or stand for any length of time, Chris often had to carry me to and from the bathroom, I ate a concoction of slow and fast release analgesics, I visited A&amp;E a couple of times a week. I remember looking forward to my surgery because I was going to be normal. I was going to be a new me. However I had the surgery and life was different, but I wasn't normal. I had pain again only a few weeks after my surgery; i wasn't pain free and normal. I remember the soul destroying and heart wrenching disappointment when the pain came back. I was devastated. I hadn't allowed pain to be a potential outcome, I had been completely over zealous and set my heart on an unrealistic outcome. 
I hurt both physically and mentally for a long time, I mourned a life unknown...not lost. You see the thing is I've had endometriosis since I've been 13, I've never known pain free, normal to me isn't pain free. I wasn't pain free from my surgery but I was much better. So I started to readjust my expectations. 
The hard cold fact is my body has been attacked by endometriosis for 13 years, that's 13 years of mass internal bleeding, that's 13 years of scarring, that's 13 years of adhesions, that's 13 years of muscles distorted to protect themselves from the pain. Plus 4 surgeries, 4 times my abdomen has been sliced and torn open, 4 times I've been poked and proded, 4 times my body had to knit itself closed and heal...and I had the damn cheek to ask my body to be pain free?! I was surprised when it wasn't?! Hell I'm lucky this body of mine manages to get itself out of bed some days and stay vertical!
Since my last surgery I have really learned the importance of expectations, aiming for what's achievable and celebrating the improvements - instead of wishing they'd be more significant. I have an incurable illness; sometimes it sucks, sometimes it's cruel but it is what it is and torturing myself over unachievable ambitions is a self punishment I could do without.
This evening I look back over the last few months with a smile, I had some lovely times. I've been on a few holidays that would have been impossible this time last year. I've had a job where I stood for 8 ,9, 10 hours (it may not be my dream job but I was able to do it). I have a car that I can actually drive regularly because I'm not on constant slow release mind muddling opioids (there have actually been days I haven't needed much pain relief). I have been able to get out to see my friends, I've drank wine with Chris, I've danced at weddings, I've had lots of laughs and made some beautiful memories. I have had a beautiful wonderful perfectly imperfect time.
It's important to reflect upon what you do have rather that what you don't. What you have gained rather than what you have lost. What opportunities lay ahead rather than what obstacles block your way.
Yes I am currently sweating from every orifice, yes I am currently pooping every other minute because of my wonderful bowel prep (this has taken much longer to write than it should have), yes tomorrow my body will undergo its 5th surgical assault but nevertheless I am smiling. I am excited to see what I gain because of tomorrow. I am excited for the opportunities my surgery will create. This time I have no doubt I will be in pain, I have no doubt that the aches will resurface, I have no doubt I'll have to work relentlessly until I'm exhausted rehabilitating my body; despite this I am happy, hopeful and excited - a new me will emerge tomorrow.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/3sfw10/expectations/,0

(Rating your pain higher than a ""10"" isn't necessarily a poor use of the scale, it's just different than how someone else might use it.)

I've also had severe pain in my left ovary where he removed a lot of lesions and scar tissue, which again he said I shouldn't be feeling any pain...I've been instructed not to come in for an appointment to assess ongoing symptoms with him, but to take ibuprofen for the pain and wait until I need my depo shot again (I called his nurse who spoke with him).

136,endometriosis_524te1_1,"So, since I started my period at 12 years old (I am now 19) I have suffered with long (7-9 day), painful, extremely heavy periods. When I was sixteen after months of agonising pain during, I was diagnosed with a 13cm ovarian cyst, which was surgically removed. I do however still suffer from terribly heavy periods. I don't know whether this points towards endo but I do think it's worth mentioning. 
For the last 3 months I have had persistent thrush-like symptoms without the itching; a lot of very thick white discharge with the consistency of dead skin, and pain during sex. I have been to the doctors at least 5 times where they have tested for STI's, thrush, BV, and cancer. The only test that came back positive was for thrush - which I have been treated for unsuccessfully five times with different drugs. My doctor told me that even though I test positively for thrush this is common for a lot of women to have and may not be the cause of the symptoms, yet she has done nothing to investigate otherwise! 
I also have had instances of excruciating pain in the top of my leg between my hips. 
It is also worth mentioning I have the copper coil (IUD) which I had inserted a year ago, therefore I don't believe it has anything to do with that. 
Another possible symptom is that I am very bloated and constipated a lot of the time. 
Has anyone who has been diagnosed suffered these symptoms (especially the discharge and pain)? And if you were, what should I do next? 
Any help will be really appreciated as I am getting very anxious about it.

So I had laser surgery a year ago and got essentially no relief. Currently, I've been doing a lot of research into the immunological aspect of endo (super interesting new study here:http://endometriosisnews.com/2016/01/25/uterine-leukocyte-function-and-dysfunction-a-hypothesis-on-the-impact-of-endometriosis/)  and will be trying plaquenil per this study (http://endometriosisnews.com/2016/01/20/effect-of-hydroxychloroquine-and-characterization-of-autophagy-in-a-mouse-model-of-endometriosis/) which I linked to in a previous post. I was hoping to have surgery at the Center for Endo Care in Atlanta, but it's just too far and way, *way* too expensive. So I'm wondering what to do next...I'm thinking of just having another surgery at my local hospital to stop these ever-worsening cycles, and hoping that plaquenil will also do something. There is only one excision specialist in my state and she's almost 2 hours away. For those of you who have had excision surgery, does it really make a difference? I've read that it does, of course, but it seems like so many women still struggle after excision so I'm starting to wonder if it's worth all the trouble to try to track down a specialist right now.

257,Endo_6gobxc_0,"So. Long journey, please bear with me.        
Back in November, i had ( what i now know was) an endometrial cyst rupture and put me in the hospital for 3 days. No surgeries were done, they just monitored me and drugged me the whole time. I followed up with that doctor, we'll call him Dr. Dick, and had to keep insisting that there was still something terribly wrong. (Nonstop pain) He kept me on various pain killers and birth controls and then finally in February, he agreed to do surgery. That's when he found that i had endo. One of my ovaries was shot, so he took that, along with my tubes (i don't want kids).  When I followed up with him and asked about the endo and what that means, and how it might effect my life, Dr. Dick said ""it won't"" and that was the end of it. So after I was all healed up, i started feeling similar pains on the side that I still has an ovary. I got a scan and Dr. Dick said basically ""Yeah there's another cyst but it's probably unrelated so you're fine."" and then that was the end of it.        
So that's when I found this sub, and then Nancy's nook, and then a really awesome doctor, we'll call him Dr. O'Cool. So my husband and I go to my first appointment with Dr. O'Cool and he literally talks with us for an hour and a half! I don't think I'd talked to Dr. Dick for that much time in total over 6 months. Anyway, he talked to us about everything endo related and answered all of our questions. He took a look around and saw that my uterus was immoble which was causing my pain (which was nonstop). We assured him that we absolutely do not want kids and if we change our minds in the future, we'd actually prefer to adopt. So he said he'd do excision, a hysterectomy, appendectomy, and with my family history, the gallbladder might also need to go. I told him if the other ovary is screwed up, he can take that too.  Basically i said he could take anything I don't need to live, but definitely take anything that has been or will cause me pain. Like i said, the pain was nonstop basically from November.       
So my surgery was on the first and, man he cleaned up shop! Uterus, appendix, gallbladder, ovary, and while he was in there, he did a bladder suspension to prevent me from needing one later.  My mom was like ""He can do that?! Why couldn't they have done that with MY hyst?!""          
The surgery went great, and he did an awesome job of getting the gas out before closing me up. I had almost NO gas pain so that was awesome. A couple of days after surgery i seemingly wet the bed... Twice!  I was awake for the second time and it was totally uncontrollable and seemed to be coming out of my vagina. So i texted Dr. O'Cool (yes he gave me his cell number) and even though it was a Sunday, he told me to go ahead and go to the ER and he'd see me there. They ran tests, did scans, and figured out that i had an abscess. And Dr. O'Cool said i was on the verge of getting really sick so it was a really good thing i came in. They got me on antibiotics, put a drain in me and kept me for a few days until my fever stayed down. They're gonna look at the drain tomorrow to see if it's time to come out. Even with all that, i feel 10x better than i did 10 days after the last surgery. My bruising is way less, I'm in less pain, and generally just feeling better. I feel super confident that this shit has finally been taken care of.

I am turning 17 in just a month, so hearing all your painful experiences as a young adult and older, dealing with it makes me incredibly sad and sorry. No one should live through that pain and ignorance for years. Although my pain is manageable with medicine, I'm starting to suffer too quickly on my first days so I have to miss occasionally one day of school just to curl up and hope the painkillers work. Sometimes it does. Sometimes it doesn't.  THe pain kind of climbs from the right side to the left in slow gradual rises and less pain as if i can feel the contractions itself. Then it repeats. My period only lasts a mere 5 days but it only hits like a truck the very first day  and gone the rest, but sometimes i can feel it on the second or third too. Its not very clear nor can I predict it. I don't typically feel pain outside my designated time,  but a few times ( with my last one being the most severe) I could feel the ovulation that could only be compared to my actual period cramps. I normally never felt it before. IT goes on and off with a sharp occasional stab every day. Or every few days. But it doesn't end when ovulation should stop. It continues on until my period starts. It does feel like the pain is progressively getting worse each time. My lower dose of meds from elementary school no longer work. Now it has to be a higher dose or extra strength. Using the washroom during my pain usually results in tiny chunks of diarrhea. When I experienced the pain before I went to the hospital, trying to use the washroom as relief, my feces were a little strangely dark, or black, small, and strange. I don't feel anything that bad though, so I don't know if i was bleeding internally.It might have been the medication. Ill find out next time I use the loo.

However, these tissues I am passing are not red but pink and soft and not easily torn apart (as a clot would be). Right after my surgery I passed pieces similar to this for a couple of days, so I assumed it was the endo that was excised just being passed out of my body. These tissues now look alot like the ones I passed during my surgery. Is it possible that my body is still getting rid of whatever endo didn't get washed out during the hysteroscopy and D&amp;C? More than worried, I am just intrigued by these things. My logic tells me its endo (which is good in a way because it means my body is getting rid of what was left behind), but then who knows.

I told her I'd also been putting it off because I've been really nervous about it and already had an idea of what it could be. I explained that I had developed Melasma about 2 years ago and was just diagnosed with it the month before. Explained that it may have occurred due to a hormonal imbalance. Then I went into full detail with everything I have experienced with my menstrual cycle during the last 4-5 years. I explained how I usually have 5-days of spotting before my period begins. I explained how bad my cramps can get, and how Advil and Midol don't help. The pain is sometimes debilitating, but I have just dealt with it. Once, a few years ago, I was experiencing such awful cramps that I broke out in a cold sweat and next thing I remembered was waking up on my bathroom floor covered in sweat. Then this last Fall of 2017, I woke up one night because I started having bad menstrual cramps. Went to the restroom, and then it hit me out of nowhere. Excruciating cramps, to the point I became disoriented and almost felt like I was going to pass out. I knew I needed to get back to my bed, and some how I managed to stumble back, but I just collapsed on to the bed. It woke up my partner who quickly realized something was very wrong. I remember her asking me what was wrong and not being able to really respond because of the pain. The only word I managed to get out was, ""cramps"". I laid there in the fetal position, covered in a cold sweat. She quickly grabbed the heating pad for my back, and a cold rag for my forehead. She made me take some Midol, but the cramps were not subsiding. 20 minutes into this excruciating pain, the possibility of calling 911 was suggested. Thankfully, my cramps began to slowly subside from excruciating pain to bearable pain.  I was able to talk again, and I just laid there in exhaustion from the pain I had just experienced.

After years of chronic pelvic pain, heavy periods, I started inquiring again about my condition. I was given different hormonal treatments but nothing seemed to work. Two years ago, I started having flank pain, blood in urine and kidney infection like symptoms that put me in the hospital which is when my suspicions of endo on my urinary tract started. This happened again around 3 months later. I was told by the emergency doctor that other than a ""benign"" cyst, I looked perfectly healthy and was sent on my way with a bottle of morphine pills. I was diagnosed with endometriosis by laparoscopy last year and had an 8 cm endometrial cyst removed as well as endo on my ovaries,  cul de sac, and bladder. I needed surgery because I was at risk for ovarian torsion. My symptoms, improved, but never went away. I still had deep pain that cycled with my periods and I started getting flank pain again 4 months after my surgery. I'm a scientist, so I did what I do best and researched as much as I could and asked my specialist about endometriosis on my urinary tract. She said likely it wasn't because its rare (OK sure) but that I could have endometriosis on my diaphragm (is that not more rare?) which is causing the flank pain. She admitted to not checking for urinary tract endo since it wasn't common procedure (even though she knew about the flank pain).

I got my first period when I was 10, (23 now) they have been excruciating ever since. However upon my last period, (oct.9th) I never stopped bleeding and about 2 weeks into it I started getting worse and worse pain. The pain began to get so bad that prescription pain medication wouldn't even touch it. I had to start calling out of work, I haven't been eating so much because of the pain, etc. I made an appointment with the only gyno in town as that I have an ovarian cyst and wanted to know what was going on. I get in and get examined and finally he tells me this, ""yeah you still have a cyst there and you are bleeding but you dont have any free fluid and I cant do anything for you. Go to the ER and get a follow up with me."" Naturally the no help made me feel dismissed and extremely angry. Nonetheless I went to the ER and they didnt prescribe me with anything nor give me a diagnosis. I am at my sanitys end with the healthcare system and make an appointment with a doctor over an hour away. He pulls up my records and I provided my own copies of my scans and records that I had looked over (my left ovary is sitting extremely high up and over double the size of my right arm the time of my er visit). Instead of taking me to an exam room I get pulled back into an office and he says he wants me to describe the pain and my health history. He is almost without a doubt before I even sit down that I have endometriosis and says based off of the pain and how my periods have always been bad that it's probably in the 90% range of likely. I do not have health insurance and currently we are exploring 2 options at the same time, orilissa (sp?) and doing a laparoscopic to see if it is and maybe give me some relief and if not, well what can we see while in there (I have tons of other health issues). Well my pain levels have not changed at all and we havent come to a decision on which route to explore because of the money issue. I have fallen behind in work, house work, my marriage has had issues, friendships, etc. How can I find enough relief to go about my day without snapping at everyone and being able to do at least a load of laundry without crying?

528,endometriosis_8qhzav_0,I've been struggling with unexplained pain and bleeding for the past 3 years. Been in to see many different doctors at different times when it's been particularly bad. None of them had explanations for it so had me try out various types of contraception and go in for different tests which didn't provide any conclusive results. Last month I went in to see a doctor when it had got particularly bad and wrote down all my symptoms. She said she was pretty certain it's endometriosis and to try the marina coil before considering surgery. So I got it in last week and everything was fine but just last night I started getting super intense pain in my lower back. It kept me up all night and I'm off work today because I can't sit up without pain.  Has anyone else had a similar experience with the marina?

They could happen at any time. Then I started spotting, saw an OBGYN and was put on the pill in addition to my depo. Didn't help. Then they tried just estrogen (thinking progesterin + progesterin/estrogen put my progesterin out of whack). Still didn't work. Normal ultrasound as well. My OBGYN poked around in my medical history. Painful periods, painful sex (my first bf was upset that I was always saying ""ow!""). Then she did a pelvic exam earlier this week and when she hit the "" cul-de-sac"" I practically screamed! She highly suggested laparoscopy. She told me she was almost positive it was my ailment and the whole ""only way to get a positive diagnosis"" thing.

* 8 months ago: uterine/menstrual-type cramping began at random times, and became constant. Lower left quadrant pain started--sometimes sharp, sometimes achy/throbbing, sometimes what feels like an internal tattoo or a fish hook dragging.
* Saw a doctor who thought it was an infection and treated me for ureaplasma.
* Pain continued, then got really bad and basically ceased most activity.; ultrasound &amp; CT scan clear.
* A few months after cramping began, started having tons of GI issues the few days before and during my period. I don't think the cramping was horrible but I just felt horrible all the time, lots of diarrhea, nausea, raw stomach, etc. This happened 3 months in a row. Began to have more frequent GI problems (I've never had a great stomach anyway). 
* Saw a specialist who thought it may be endometriosis; started Gildess birth control with no off-week (was previously on Apri). A few days later, received call saying I had tested positive for ureaplasma (this is a different doc) and took antibiotics for it. I saw a lot of relief but it's unclear whether it was from the Gildess or antibiotics because I started them around the same time.

When I followed up with him and asked about the endo and what that means, and how it might effect my life, Dr. Dick said ""it won't"" and that was the end of it. So after I was all healed up, i started feeling similar pains on the side that I still has an ovary. I got a scan and Dr. Dick said basically ""Yeah there's another cyst but it's probably unrelated so you're fine."" and then that was the end of it.        
So that's when I found this sub, and then Nancy's nook, and then a really awesome doctor, we'll call him Dr. O'Cool. So my husband and I go to my first appointment with Dr. O'Cool and he literally talks with us for an hour and a half! I don't think I'd talked to Dr. Dick for that much time in total over 6 months. Anyway, he talked to us about everything endo related and answered all of our questions. He took a look around and saw that my uterus was immoble which was causing my pain (which was nonstop). We assured him that we absolutely do not want kids and if we change our minds in the future, we'd actually prefer to adopt. So he said he'd do excision, a hysterectomy, appendectomy, and with my family history, the gallbladder might also need to go. I told him if the other ovary is screwed up, he can take that too.  Basically i said he could take anything I don't need to live, but definitely take anything that has been or will cause me pain. Like i said, the pain was nonstop basically from November.       
So my surgery was on the first and, man he cleaned up shop! Uterus, appendix, gallbladder, ovary, and while he was in there, he did a bladder suspension to prevent me from needing one later.  My mom was like ""He can do that?! Why couldn't they have done that with MY hyst?!""          
The surgery went great, and he did an awesome job of getting the gas out before closing me up. I had almost NO gas pain so that was awesome. A couple of days after surgery i seemingly wet the bed... Twice!  I was awake for the second time and it was totally uncontrollable and seemed to be coming out of my vagina. So i texted Dr. O'Cool (yes he gave me his cell number) and even though it was a Sunday, he told me to go ahead and go to the ER and he'd see me there. They ran tests, did scans, and figured out that i had an abscess. And Dr. O'Cool said i was on the verge of getting really sick so it was a really good thing i came in. They got me on antibiotics, put a drain in me and kept me for a few days until my fever stayed down. They're gonna look at the drain tomorrow to see if it's time to come out. Even with all that, i feel 10x better than i did 10 days after the last surgery. My bruising is way less, I'm in less pain, and generally just feeling better. I feel super confident that this shit has finally been taken care of.

I’m now 24, and a month and a half ago I was switched from Lo Loestrin Fe to Taytulla. At first I thought it was working great, no symptoms, and my period actually started when it was supposed to! One week after my period ended, had a major migraine, have been extremely nauseas almost every day, and now today I am having the worst cramps I have ever had in my life. For the past year or two I have also been having discomfort during sex. Could my birth control have been managing the symptoms, and now the change in medicine is bringing them out? I might go to my OBGYN tomorrow but I’m worried they aren’t going to take the symptoms seriously.

the pain is so bad i take pills every like, five hours because if i let it get ahead of me ill be out of it for a couple hours until the medicine works again. i literally dont care about the affects of taking so much medication cuz if i dont im in so much pain. and it takes So Long to start working. sometimes i just have to sit in the bath so itll stop for a while.
the thing is, my mom says this is just life. she said she was like this until she had kids so she doesnt really care about taking me to see a doctor for it. i guess since im going to live on my own soon for college i can go to the doctor then but in the meantime im just wondering if any of these symptoms sound similar to endo?

I told her I'd also been putting it off because I've been really nervous about it and already had an idea of what it could be. I explained that I had developed Melasma about 2 years ago and was just diagnosed with it the month before. Explained that it may have occurred due to a hormonal imbalance. Then I went into full detail with everything I have experienced with my menstrual cycle during the last 4-5 years. I explained how I usually have 5-days of spotting before my period begins. I explained how bad my cramps can get, and how Advil and Midol don't help. The pain is sometimes debilitating, but I have just dealt with it. Once, a few years ago, I was experiencing such awful cramps that I broke out in a cold sweat and next thing I remembered was waking up on my bathroom floor covered in sweat. Then this last Fall of 2017, I woke up one night because I started having bad menstrual cramps. Went to the restroom, and then it hit me out of nowhere. Excruciating cramps, to the point I became disoriented and almost felt like I was going to pass out. I knew I needed to get back to my bed, and some how I managed to stumble back, but I just collapsed on to the bed. It woke up my partner who quickly realized something was very wrong. I remember her asking me what was wrong and not being able to really respond because of the pain. The only word I managed to get out was, ""cramps"". I laid there in the fetal position, covered in a cold sweat. She quickly grabbed the heating pad for my back, and a cold rag for my forehead. She made me take some Midol, but the cramps were not subsiding. 20 minutes into this excruciating pain, the possibility of calling 911 was suggested. Thankfully, my cramps began to slowly subside from excruciating pain to bearable pain.  I was able to talk again, and I just laid there in exhaustion from the pain I had just experienced.

She says she's handled several cases of Sciatic Endometriosis and feels comfortable removing it using the da Vinci robot. She confirmed that I had an endometrioma on my ovary and said she's only had to remove 4 ovaries in her career, seems optimistic that my ovary will be fixed and work as normal. She agreed to place the mirena while I'm under and said it shouldn't be a problem as she's only seen a few women who truly can't fit the mirena. If all goes well with it, it should prevent endometriomas growing on my ovaries. She'll be doing a lidocaine tap block and will be rotating ibuprofen and tylenol around the clock with oxycodone for backup if there's breakthrough pain.

I’ve been putting this decision off for 4 months now, doing research and browsing this sub, but this week, the pain was so intense I couldn’t move, again. I missed more work, again. I’m not even menstruating, it’s the ovulation pain I’m feeling, at least that’s what I was told by the OBGYN 4 months ago when she gave me these options. So. Here’s my story.  As TLDR as I can make it:
I started menstruation at an early age and at first I’d bleed for weeks, have a week off, and start again. I became extremely anemic among other issues.  Eventually I was put in oral bc. Although I struggled with period related issues for many years I don’t remember the pain being unbearable until I was 15-16. By time I was 20, the doctors had tested me for every G I issued under the sun.  I had been in the ER more times then I can count with complaints of pain.  Had a few small ovarian cysts come and go. A doctor had said it was endo but nothing was confirmed.  Tried a few different types of orals contraceptives. Had my gall balder and appendix removed, they were not functioning correctly and had massive amounts of scar tissue. During this procedure, and obgyn resident was present and reported back that I had no signs of endo, apparently the explored while they were in there.   Needless to say when the pain came back. Went on the depo, gained 40 lbs and still was in pain.  Stoped depo after the 2 shot (6 months) and just quit hormone medication completely.  
During that time (23-25) my period settled down and actually became regular.  Pain was there but only during peak days.  I felt like a normal girl. I was also living healthier and eating healthier.  So that helped too. Then. The pelvic pain and nausea slowly started back in and now I’m in unbearable pelvic and right hip pain some days.  And mostly bearable all other days.  Went into the MD when, among other symptoms, the pain became constant all month. She recommended mirana or implanon.  I hate both options, but as I sit here wasting another day on the couch and missing work, I realize I need to do SOMETHING.

I'm 18 almost 19 and have had the textbook endo symptoms since I was 11/12 (got my period at 9). I would bleed through giant grandma pads in half an hour with giant clots and stuff. Went to the doctor and the solution was birth control. Started on the regular 3 week on one week off pill till I was about 15 and was put on the continuous non stop pill to help constant cramps and break through bleeding.
 It helped for awhile but around a year/2 years ago I started getting break though bleeding all the time again. I've been switched to many different pills and its only gotten worse. Ive had horrible digestive system problems this whole time and sometimes anal bleeding  and have had a colonoscopy with no results. My gynecologist told me that I couldnt have endometriosis if I had pains outside my period and that ""18 was too young to develop it anyways"". I'm getting so lost and confused in everything. 
I've been seeing my family care regular doctor for almost everything since the gyno doesnt think theres anything wrong with me. Ive had a pap smear, ultrasounds, 5 different types of birth control pills, blood tests and everything seems to be normal hormonally. Nothing can explain my constant cramps/vaginal pain and bleeding.
 However in the past 6 I've lost a lot of weight (210 pounds to 150) and am now constantly on my period. Every single day I have horrible cramps, aches, period shits the whole deal. My doctor thinks that I'm just hormonally off which makes sense but we've been trying different pills and it's only gotten worse. She suggest I try getting an IUD and suggest skyla. I'm a virgin so it terrifies me but if it's what I have to do to stop this constant bleeding than I guess its necessary. Also not sure if this is really connected but I've developed TMJ recently and my doctor thinks that it could be related to an overall inflammation problem possibly endometriosis (my family doctor not the gyno)
So I'm posting here to see if anyone has had a similar journey. I just feel so lost and confused after having the gyno tell me I was over reacting and that I was too young to have problems (she even treated me like a little kid and had me hold a plush uterus and explain to me what it was) to having my family doctor suggest I have endo but not want to investigate it and go for the IUD.
 Has anyone had constant bleeding and cramping and gotten the IUD for it? Or just had improved symptoms on the IUD? Or many just had off hormone problems for years and got over it somehow?

I've talked to my ob/gyn and general physician both of which brushed me off. I get this intense pain where my legs feel very tight (almost like a cramp but not quite) but they stay that way ALL day.

989,endometriosis_cga4mj_4,"After Nine months with the Kyleena my mom thought it could be the IUD causing these symptoms, because in the back of the pamphlet it has a list of like less than 10% have these symptoms and it included depression, migraines, cramps, heavy bleeding, and other stuff. So I had my third IUD removed and it was hell. Everyday Bleeding, Headache, vomiting, unbearable cramps. I was 15 at this point and my freshmen year I had missed around 20 days throughout the school year and like the maximum amount of days was 18 and then you had to repeat. But I went to a Public Charter School and they didn't care as long as you completed the work. During my freshmen year I was home from school because of my period and my dogs tripped me down the stairs and I had a concussion. My history teacher noticed I was being super weird and he dragged me to the nurse. And there was a girl sitting there and we got to talking and she said she had endometriosis and she got cramps so bad she passed out, at the time I was like, *well I'm not in that much pain*. But then a year later l I had started passing out and even fainted a few times myself because of the pain. Then in my sophomore year in the first semester I had already missed 22 days. It got so bad I basically  went to school one day a week and ended up dropping out of school in January. Then I transferred to a Public High school and still barely went. It just seemed like a waste of time I was in all senior AP classes as a 15 year old and still felt unchallenged, barely showed up and was having the worst symptoms of my life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/cga4mj/i_dropped_out_of_high_school_because_of_my_period/,0

991,endometriosis_ai1goz_1,"For the past 10 years I have had increasing painful periods. Basically, I can always feel when I am ovulating or anything is going on down there. Often feel bloated and have many bowel issues anytime I feel activity/pain in my lower abdomen. I am often  fatigued. My mother suffered from endometriosis and eventually had a hysterectomy at 35. After talking with her about my symptoms she seemed to think I have endo. My GP referred me to a gynaecologist after discussing my symptoms. I had been to this gyno previously because I had abnormal cells show up on my pap and has to get them frozen off my cervix. Anyways, I get an ultrasound and receive my results. The doctor saw something weird and didn’t know what it was. He said it could be adenomyosis or some sort of growth. So I went for another ultrasound and they booked me for an MRI. After both of those I went back to the gyno and he said there was nothing there, maybe a small spot of endo on one Fallopian tube. After my first visit to my GP she prescribed me the lowest hormonal birth control you can get (Lolo). It helped for awhile but since then I just feel physically ill and am in pain. The gyno asked me how my pain was and just told me to stay on my birth control. I get severe anxiety and it doubles when I am on hormonal birth control. I have been able to handle it this time with medication and therapy. I have tried the Mirena. It was a total disaster and makes me totally paranoid about putting anything else in my body.

992,Endo_bivd44_0,"Had my annual today and was determined to ask for help getting set up with a laprascopy.  Just like she did last year, she immediately asks, “why do you think you have endo?”
I list as many of my problematic symptoms as I can think of: bloating, irregular periods, prolonged periods, bleeding after sex, spotting all of the time, back pain that interferes with my daily life, vaginal aches and pains, knife like pains sometimes in rectum, and other things.  This time I really tried to express myself and reiterate that my life revolves around my periods and I’m miserable cycle-wide.  She was not concerned and told me that exercise can “solve all of these issues for you.”  And that there isn’t much of a point anyway because I can’t be on hormones after my blood clot.  Literally that’s all she had offer.  She did not offer to set me up with a specialist for a laprascopy as I requested and instead set me up with an ultrasound and a follow up appointment.  I’ve had many ultrasounds in previous years and they’ve found nothing.  Any dodo can do some quick research and know that ultrasounds are not in anyway a reliable means for diagnosing endo.
I’m just so upset.  Even if it isn’t endometriosis, I have a right to know that.  I want more than just, “ExErCiSe is tHe CuRE aLL.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/bivd44/i_asked_a_second_time_for_a_laprascopy/,0
