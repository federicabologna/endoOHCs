After an ultrasound they discovered 2 cysts which they believe are endometriomas in and on left ovary. After six weeks they followed it up with a second ultra sound that showed left ovary now has 3 cysts and they have increased in size (largest is 7 plus cm). The gyno recommended surgery to remove cysts on left ovary only. I am very concerned about the c-word since my CA 125 was 90 during ovulation and 150 during period so I wanted whole ovary removed. We compromised and she put me on bc combo pills without a break to see if the CA 125 would come down prior to surgery. Two weeks into bc pills, my period arrived 5 days late but the cramps  have been horrible for two days now even with taking Advils and Tylenol (feels as if I am taking nothing). Also, sometimes I get weird burning sensation in my left area where I assume cysts are located. I am not sure what to do (I have messaged the doctor) but I am freaking out a bit.

I\u2019ve made changes like exercise, nutritionist, weening down my PPI meds. But it only seems like it\u2019s getting worse. Has anyone else experienced this and it ended up being Endo? I\u2019m at a loss and ready to schedule a laparoscopy to know for sure. My gyno wants me to try an IUD but I\u2019ve had terrible side effects from every birth control I\u2019ve tried and would like to avoid it at all costs.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/pl975n/reflux_digestive_issues_horrible_right_side_and/"}

{"id": "endometriosis_kzvhrf_1", "text": "I was recently put on orilissa because my periods are life stopping basically. They are incredibly painful. The orilissa is still new for me, but my period just started today and I do admit my period has decreased in pain already. Normally I would be curled up in bed crying, but although there is pain it's not overbearing. The only problem with orilissa is I can only take it for a year max before it starts impacting me, and she told me that if the dosage ever needs to increase then that time is shortened. So it's like.... I will just end up back where I started basically? My doctor has basically been against the surgery. She said she really doesn't like to put her patients through surgery because she has found that a lot of them come back because the endometriosis has reoccurred or come back because the surgery didn't work at all. She also mentioned that is a number of risks with any surgery, and that surgery is not a cure for endometriosis just another management so she rather not approve the surgery just for me to end up with endo again in 5 years while also gaining another potential problem from the risks. It is just really hard because I am tired of having all these issues. I already had Hashimoto's disease before this which impacts my life on and off, but at least Hashimoto's didn't cause me enormous amounts of pain like Endo does. Before anyone asks since I wasn't diagnosed through surgery. Yes, she checked for everything else. I have had every test imaginable that could explain my symptoms. Endometriosis was all that was left because everything else came back normal. I'm sorry I am just really overwhelmed recently because not only am I dealing with endometriosis but my thyroid levels are out of wack too.

I have since seen 8 different medical professionals for my symptoms of heavy periods so bad that I have had to be put on iron during them in the past, irregular periods(months in between and then lasting for months), pelvic pain, cramping, back pain, and just so much more fun. Being told this was normal or at most I was just fat. Two months ago, I saw a new doctor and she brought up PCOS, Endo, and a variety of other things. We did blood work and she looked at my previous ultrasounds. Everything was normal so now we decided to move forward with a diagnostic laproscopy. At my appointment, she told me the large gaps in my period could not be from Endo but all of my other symptoms it is possible from Endo. She said the large gaps are most likely due from high amounts of stress or from being overweight. I told my dad this and now he is hesitant about me proceeding with this.

The pain feels terrible and sometimes it\u2019s everywhere including my upper abdomen(below my ribs), my sides , chest and this pain and suffocating feel in my neck that radiates to my head. Migraines too for hours that makes me unable to fall asleep. I have constant back pain although the intensity varies but it\u2019s usually bad and sometimes I can\u2019t even sit down. It radiates down my legs sometimes to my feet too. Painkillers does nearly nothing for it. And the chronic pelvic pain too that feels like a deep migraine and sometimes stabbing pains. It\u2019s worse on my right side. Thigh pains too and it hurts to touch. The painful bloating and malaise. Chronic fatigue and insomnia. My joints and muscle hurt most of the time. Pain in my right arm when it gets really bad. At this point if there\u2019s any trigger I have no idea what it is. Stress is the only thing I know for sure. And this isn\u2019t even on my period. I get cramps days before and when it finally starts it\u2019s the worst thing ever and gets worse if I do something stressful.

{"id": "Endo_juvzai_0", "text": "VERY LONG POST SORRY. Hi all. I did have another account on here but I can't get logged in so I created a new one ages ago.\nBrief history- was diagnosed in February this year with Endo, after 10+ years of symptoms. I'm 26. I'm from Scotland, UK. It was found on my Uterosacral Ligaments, POD and elsewhere (can post exact details in comments). I did have an MRI in August last year that indicated bowel and bladder involvement and organs fused together, adhesions, thickening etc. None of this was picked up on the Laparoscopy. It was done by a general Gynaecologist and not a specialist. It was treated with Helica (ablation), not excision. I was due a follow up with my own consultant in August (he didn't even do the damn surgery), but then it was cancelled due to Covid. My symptoms improved for a few months but now I'm back to square one again and I feel absolutely fucking awful. My symptoms are terrible, 100x worse. I've since saught the advice off a private Gynaecologist in Glasgow who also works the NHS, he works at the Endometriosis centre in Glasgow. I had a telephone consultation with him in June. He suggested Decapeptyl injections once a month for 3 months, then a 3 monthly one. Fast forward to now and my symptoms are not improving, even on the Decapeptyl. I went to see him face to face on the 9th of this month. I explained all the above. He said that I should get the 3 month injection as I may see a difference after the full 6 months of treatment. I however disagree, he thinks it's my periods that need to stop and that's why I'm not getting much relief (I had a breakthrough bleed a few weeks ago as I'm late getting my 3 month injection). I did explain that I have all the classic Endo symptoms out with my period too. I was on the Depo injection for 4 years and it stopped my periods altogether, but I still had horrific symptoms. \nDespite him recommending another injection, he said I need a referral to the Endometriosis centre. He said he suspects I have Deep infiltrating disease that needs treating with Excision. He said the Helica treatment and the injections have proved ineffective and incomplete, and due to possible/suspected bowel and bladder involvement I qualify for Referral. I am outside the health board area of the centre, so I need to get my own consultant to reffer me. The private Gynaecologist is writing to my GP with the above concerns. \nMy issue/concern is this. I finally have my follow up appointment with my own consultant tomorrow. It is a telephone consultation. I am extremely nervous/worried he will dismiss me and reffer to refuse me. I had a Laparoscopy in March last year where nothing was found, he then told me before I I managed to persuade him to do an MRI 'I doubt they'll find anything on the MRI, and they won't have missed anything on your Laparoscopy'. That is what I am dealing with.\nPlease please if anyone has any advice on how to approach my consultant regarding all this, I would so appreciate it.\nMy quality of life is so so terrible atm and I'm so worried I've been let down again and will continue to be if I don't get the right treatment. \nThanks for reading, I apologise for the length. \nXx", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/juvzai/follow_up_appointment_feeling_really_nervous/"}

I had an exam and cried from the pain, and next day I had an ultrasound that showed nothing. I made the choice to have a lap and a D&amp;C. A week before surgery I had a kidney infection, caused by all the swelling shutting my urethra and prevent me from using the restroom. I went to the ER with a fever of 105. It cleared up with antibiotics. \nSurgery went well. My nerve pain was very bad, so my doctor cut my uterine nerve. I healed great with beautiful scarring.

I'm in my 20s, don't want to get too specific. But recently my cramping and sharp, shooting, and twinging pains have gotten much worse, especially on my right side. It hurts to press down on my lower right side, and it isn't my appendix. I feel pain through my vagina and when pressing on the side of my cervix. I have pain down my thighs and tugging sensations sometimes in my uterus or on my side. I suspect endometriosis and my ob/gyn said it could be, but it could also be the fibroids due to their location. But I really suspect endometriosis, idk something is just telling me something isn't right and something more is going on and this pain is so strange and sometimes so bad. I don't have bad periods bleeding-wise but they are VERY painful the first few days, especially lately. All this stuff has hit me at once pretty recently and idk what to do about it because I barely had symptoms before, not like this. I've always had bad period cramps but this is all so new.

{"id": "endometriosis_9x07it_0", "text": "Ever since coming off Depo Provera last November, I have noticed a change in my periods. First of all, they\u2019re not as regular as they used to be (however, it is possible that they\u2019re just starting to regulate after coming off Depo). When I do have a period, they\u2019re not exactly heavy but they are painful (bloating, cramps that begin before period and approximately 3 days during period, lower back pain) which I have never really experienced before. I sometimes experience abdominal pain during ovulation. Also I tend to have diarrhoea at least once a day on the days leading up to my period and also during. The last period I had was the most painful one I have ever experienced. Paracetamol and ibuprofen did not help at all, although a hot water bottle eased the pain a little. Over the past year, there have been times where no matter what stage I\u2019m at in my cycle, I get this excruciating pain in my stomach and lower back which makes me feel extremely nauseous (I\u2019ve never been physically sick from it though) and it forces me to stop whatever I\u2019m doing and lay down until it passes. It normally passes after 2-5 minutes and then I feel fine again. I\u2019ve also been experiencing pain during sex which is very uncomfortable and I have noticed some blood afterwards on toilet paper after wiping (very light, light pink in colour). I almost always feel a burning sensation when I pee after sex. I know for a fact that it isn\u2019t an STI. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal or not but thought I should mention it.

I had another loss in 2012 2 weeks before my father in law passed away. We had moved twice and I had very bad doctors. Basically they wanted me to do depo again and I refused. He my doctor in my new state said I will not give you birth control because after that last loss of pregnancy you can't get pregnant again it's not possible. So I suffered with heavy periods mood swings and cysts that would burst-rarely did I complain. Moved to my current state in 2013 got really sick for a month straight went to my primary care doctor did a pregnancy test told me I was pregnant. This was almost a year and a half after my doctor in another state said it wasn't possible. Had an amazing ob/gyn delivered my girl in July 2014. He told me immediately to get on birth control he knew I didn't want more kids. I did and I finally got relief-most days. Still have cysts last one landed me in the emergency room because I was more pain than even my labor pain! By this point I have a new doc my pregnancy doc moved on. This guy is a supposed specialist but he's like all we can do is birth control-possibly surgery. I can't do surgery again it didn't work the last time. I refuse to do depo. I finally got my weight down from almost 240 to 190. On bad days though I retain 20 pounds of fluid so I looove the looks like I'm a fatty who can't control herself when she goes out to eat-I portion control to keep my weight in check.

I'm tired of fighting doctors we moved for work not because we had wanderlust. All my doctors look over my history and are floored how sick I truly am inside it's stage 4 I grow cysts all the time the big ones cause the most pain. The only good thing is my husband-he's gone through it all with me. He has held me after surgery, our losses the infertility diagnosis, our daughter.

You can get a sleep study through your gp just if anyone has ever said you snore.  (Or if you test high on the self assesments.)

My insurance won't cover it except as the daily injection 5 mg/mL 14 day kit, available as a generic, which is what I had during IVF.    The once a month shot is $1,031 without insurance coverage.  Per shot for six months.  It's $15 per month as a daily injectable.  I'm an IVF vet, subcutaneous shots don't bother me in the slightest, bring that on!  I call my ob/gyn and ask if that's an option, he has me get the pharmacist to fax him the info, and he says he'll call my RE and see what they come up with (he's not on the bleeding edge, but he's a good doctor).  My RE and my ob/gyn are now supposedly discussing this, but at this point I'd put money on the decision being that the lower concentration won't do.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/2adqiy/ive_got_a_complicated_medical_mess_insurance/"}

I'm stepping down my dose slowly and I hope to be off it sometime in the next week or so.  One thing I've noticed that makes a big difference is fish oil--I do have some pain when I haven't taken it.  I've heard similar things reported for evening primrose oil--I guess these fatty acids have something to do with inflammatory response.  My boyfriend's mom has been an absolute saint through this ordeal and has been giving me free chiropractic adjustment.  I am amazed at how effective it is at addressing referral pain in other parts of my body.  She is amazing and deserves a lot of credit for making me feel better.

We had been discussing how there's not a cure for endo and how not every treatment works for everyone and it sometimes takes a while to find the one that works for you and somehow, the tears just started pouring. My doc was very comforting - she asked if I had a counselor or therapist to talk to, which I do, and gave me a little pep talk before I left. I took the rest of the day off for mental health and sat around eating ice cream and watching Game of Thrones, which made me feel a little better.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/1vcccw/update_gyno_appointment_tuesday_a_little_nervous/"}
