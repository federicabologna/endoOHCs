I\u2019ll be in tears, pacing, bent over, nauseous, pain down the leg, lower back, abdominal and vulva\u2026. Feeling like someone has reached inside and twisting and stabbing.

It\u2019s been 7 days since I ovulated and I\u2019m still experiencing this. I was also reading that diarrhea and constipation are also common signs, which I experience on a fairly regular basis. I have an IUD, so I don\u2019t have a period. I have recently started having some minor cramps though around the time that I would have a period. I will also occasionally have cramps after orgasm, but that\u2019s not been consistent. I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out if any of this sounds consistent with endo?

{"id": "endometriosis_ni1o61", "text": "I have been lurking here for a few months, reading so many posts, and I am truly in awe of all of you warriors.   \n\n\nThe reason I am finally posting is that I have an upcoming laparoscopic surgery using the DaVinci robot booked in the next couple of months, and I am feeling anxious about everything.   \n\n\nSo some background information that I think is relevant, I started my period when I was 11, and as far as I can remember back I had pretty severe cramping during my period, but in my early twenties, they got more and more manageable with the extent of my period pain now being on day 1 and 2, and all I need to do is take 1 ES Tylenol, and I am good to proceed with my regular day to day life. However, I did have terrible chronic lower back pain for a few years and was diagnosed with an 18 cm fibroid which was removed via an open myomectomy (vertical incision) last year. I lost a shit ton of blood, had to have a transfusion and stayed 3 nights in the hospital and had a pretty rough recovery. \n\nI am a lesbian, married to my wife for 3 years now, and we wanted to start growing our family, so a few months after my surgery, I started to see a Reproductive Endroconoligst in hopes of becoming pregnant. He did a Saline Sono and full hormone panel. After the Saline Sono, they did tell me that my right ovary appeared to be stuck to the back of the uterus and may be inaccessible if we needed to do IVF. I asked why or how, and they told me they didn't know, but it could be due to scarring from my myomectomy. But all my research online said that it could be endometriosis; when I brought that up to them, they told me it could be, but you need surgery to determine that 100% and basically deterred me from that option. I ended up doing 3 unmedicated/monitored IUI's, and all were unsuccessful.   \n\n\nI moved on to a new RE Clinic, and I requested my notes from the Saline Sono, and that's when I learned that I had adenomyosis on the back of my uterus. This was never disclosed to me and came as a huge shock. Again, I researched adenomyosis, and I found that often if you have that, you also have endometriosis. So when I went to the new clinic, they reviewed all my test results and sent me for an HSG test, which came back normal. So I was still confused as to why that tube was stuck and asked my new RE about the possibility of endo, and she said yes, it could be, but you'll need a lap to diagnose 100% and basically again deterred me from that route. So I proceeded with 2 Medicated and Monitored IUI's, producing between 2 - 3 follicles and still no success. So at this point, we were looking at IVF, and it was just unsettling to me that I would undergo a very costly and emotionally draining cycle of IVF with no explanation as to why my ovary was stuck to the back of my uterus.   \n\n\nI decided to reach out to the surgeon who performed my myomectomy and asked her if she recalled seeing any issues with my uterus or ovaries, any signs of endo or the ovary being stuck. She said she didn't and provided me with her surgical report. \n\nSo before doing any more fertility treatments, I decided to press pause and sought out an endo specialist in my area. I found a doctor who does perform excision surgeries but isn't listed on nancys nook, the only one I found on there from my state is now retired. I met with him this week, and we went over my records, and he said, let's do surgery and try and figure this out. I was kind of surprised he came to that decision so quickly, despite my lack of endo symptoms. He said he occasionally sees silent endo in his patients, and I very well could have it, and if I don't, he will do his best to free the ovary so that if I need IVF, at least I will have both accessible. I asked him why the surgeon who did my myomectomy didn't see anything, and he said doing that type of surgery is very difficult to visualize endo.   \n\n\nSo anyway, I am sorry for this ridiculously long post, and if any of you are still reading this, I just wanted to get your feedback and advice. Would you proceed with the lap despite having no symptoms besides the adenomyosis and the ovary stuck? Also, if anyone reading this has silent endo and had excision surgery, I would love to hear your stories and feedback.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/ni1o61/unsure_about_upcoming_lap_surgery/"}

I haven\u2019t had a episode since 2018. \n\nNow I\u2019m not sure if this was the rupture of a ovarian cyst being that I\u2019ve also felt the pains in my anus. But can someone clarify that it is possible to feel pain in the anus and stomach during a rupture? Or could this have been a random endo flare?

{"id": "endometriosis_pn7o1z", "text": "Hi. \n\nI have a family history of endometriosis and I periodically get a lil stressed about it because it seems to be so common/undiagnosed, even in people with clear red flag symptoms. I'm on Yaz right now, and aside from the 2 weeks of continuous spotting every now and then (basically, anytime I'm even a little late taking my BC) my period is generally under control. Which is fine, but, it does sketch me out that no one has been able to explain what happened to me/why stuff currently happens to me aside from prostaglandins.\n\nI had my first period at 11, and my second and third at 12 and 13, about 10 months apart, with about 18 days of heavy bleeding, and cramping so severe I could barely move. Just got told to take 3 ibuprofen at a time and that was it. I got slightly more regular as a teenager, with 7 days of bleeding, usually every 35 days, but sometimes more like 46-162 days. Accompanied by pretty rough pain and nausea the first two days, but I only left school once because of cramping. \n\nI'm 23 now, last year the nausea progressed to vomiting the day ahead of my period. I've never had that level of nausea in my life unless I'm extremely drunk, so it was bizarre. That's when I started the Yaz, cos essentially it felt like I had the flu for a week like 4-5 times a year and I was fucking over it. Oh, and sometime around 19-20 I got diagnosed with PMDD, which I take an antidepressant continuously for.\n\nI've had GI issues since I was about 18, and they get NOTABLY worse whenever my body decides to bleed, which also seems to be a relatively common experience among people with Endo. \n\nI have joint hypermobility which sometimes gets notably worse during withdrawal bleeds. \n\nMy symptoms are mostly fine now that I'm taking yaz continuously, aside from the fact that my uterus obeys no hormones and does what it wants re: bleeding and cycle lengths.\n\nI know it's totally possible to have real bad scarring but no pain, or barely any scarring and tons of pain, but I guess I'm trying to figure out how abnormal my baseline is, and if it's worth pursuing further beyond just taking BC.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/pn7o1z/how_did_your_menses_start_were_they_abnormal_or/"}

Diagnosed endo when I was in my late teens, almost 30 now.\n\nYesterday I experienced something new and awful for the first time.\n\nI had my regular cramping pain come on. Nothing new or unusual, just very severe and bad cramps in my uterus, regular pain for us. Enough that I was bending over and holding my uterus. I had to pee, so I went on the toilet, and my entire uterus just contracted. I've had that sort of tight contraction pain before, almost like somebody is just grabbing and squishing my uterus up into a ball. But it was ROUGH.\n\nI felt like I was going to have diarrhea as well, my butt kind of went into that muscle feeling as though it was happening, but nothing was coming out. I was dripping sweat, felt like I was going to pass out, my vision went white. My uterus was just totally stuck like that and it wasn't doing anything else, same with my bum. I had a cold towel covering my thighs, one on the back of my neck and one for my face. Any time we'd switch them out, the \"cold\" towel would just be incredibly hot and you couldn't even tell it had been soaked in wet water. Sweat was rolling down between my boobs and stomach and off my face.\n\nI ended up taking .5 of a lorazepam as well as naproxen and tylenol and just stayed sitting on the toilet like that for maybe 30 mins. I just could not move. I never ended up having an actual BM, my muscles just stayed like I was about to have diarrhea for the entire time. Once the medication combo I had started working, I could legit feel my muscles start to relax, felt the dizziness pass, and my body cooled down. I waited until I could stand up and had a nice shower and from there, I just had slight pain for the rest of the night and I'm feeling fine (or endo fine lmao) again.\n\nWhat the fuck happened? Has anybody else experienced something like this before? I have had pain while peeing and having a BM before, usually when I feel either one of those coming on or WHILE it is occurring, but nothing like this. It was also interesting because even though I was sitting on the toilet that entire time, and my behind muscles were basically stuck MID bowel movement, nothing came out. I just had a regular pee once it was all over and my body had relaxed.\n\nMy mom and bf were there and said it looked awful, my mom straight up said that looked and sounded like basically a 30 min labour lmao.

Quit taking the bc after graduation because I was having aura migraines and my doctor thought that could be causing it, haven't had them since 2011. \n\n2012: Had Mirena put in in November, bad experience, had it taken out January 2013 and ended up in the er because I was hemorrhaging from my uterus. No bc after, couldn't remember to take the pill.\n\nFirst lap in 2014 because sex hurt and my periods were awful. Only findings were a cyst, fibroids, and a retroverted uterus, put in the report \"possible early signs of endometriosis\" and I wouldn't have even known about that without getting all of my records because they didn't even mention it to me. \n\nSeptember 2018: I started getting really nauseous and had like pieces of tissue coming out of me (similar to if you bite the extra skin off your cheek), bleeding with sex, pain during, and cramping after. Went in for an exam and everything hurt and my doctor said \"you definitely have endometriosis\" \n\nSwitched doctors after that.\n\nOctober 2018: Laparoscopy after first appt to confirm endo. Said I have an adhesion on my left side and something about an Allen Masters window, and a small cyst they just left alone. Put on bc and eventually Orlissa.\n\nStarted bc with a period every month, then they told me to just skip my bleed week because it hurt too much, then the one with a period every 3 months also to skip it if I had too much pain but I'd start spotting and they told me to just stop for a few days and bleed for a couple days then continue it. I went off it for a few months last year because I was tired of the side effects and my work shut down so I didn't have to be physically there, but then got back on the one with a bleed week every month. I've been spotting for the last like 2 months, usually brown but sometimes pinkish/red. Clots too. And during my period I have decent sized clots.\n\nSex is also basically impossible. \n\nMy last exam was April 12th and hurt like hell. They said my cervix was crooked and didn't know if the endo was pulling it or something and schedule an ultrasound. Ultrasound said my ovaries looked perfect, no cysts or anything alarming, switched my bc to Lo Loestrin so my ovaries wouldn't activate at all and said come back in June and schedule another laparoscopy if it's not better. But even having the full bladder for the ultrasound killed me for like 3-4 days. The pain is extra intense if I have to pee.\n\nI'm almost done with my first week of the new bc. Spotting has stopped for now. I'm nauseous 27 days out of the month and throw up at least twice a week, but I also have a bunch of neck issues and carpal tunnel--plus I broke my toe a couple weeks ago but it only hurts now if I hit it or I'm walking for a while-- so idk if the nausea is from my endo by itself or just all the pain in general.\n\nIt feels like my ovaries are on fire, I have \"normal\" cramps basically all the time, occasionally stabby cramps and I'll blow up like a balloon randomly with worse stabby cramps that don't stop until I deflate. Any gas and it becomes unbearable very quickly, specifically on my left side. I've already maxed out on taking Orlissa so that's not an option anymore. My doctor only does ablations and told me after my laparoscopy in 2018 that I had endo but I didn't have endo that they could treat, only manage the symptoms and I didn't know enough about it back then to even know what he was talking about. I record all of my dr visits and listened to it again and I wanna smack myself for not switching doctors after that. But it's also been \"manageable\" until recently. I asked about a hysterectomy before but was told I was too young and since its not a guaranteed fix that they won't even consider it.\n\nIbuprofen and Midol do nothing now. I've tried eating turmeric, not sure if it did much though. I take muscle relaxers when I go to bed (for my neck but at least it knocks me out sometimes). I have kratom, CBD, delta-8 and normal weed so I can make myself eat because it's basically impossible otherwise. \n\nI have an appt on June 25th with a specialist I found from Nancy's Nook and I'm on the wait list for any sooner openings. I just don't know what to do for it until then because that's forever away and the only thing that does anything for the pain is heat, and even with that it's far from ideal, and once the heat stops it gets worse again. I sleep with my heating pad just about every night, and I've even put the toasty toes on the inside of my work uniform so I can at least function.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/nk02m1/pain_management_or_other_advice/"}

{"id": "endometriosis_p7h9m6", "text": "I had a laparoscopy on the 15th July. After the surgery I was told - They definitely had found a 10cm cyst on one ovary, which they removed a fair amount of and deflated. From what I can remember the gynecologist telling me / what she showed me in photos -  The other ovary was barely visible as the fallopian tube is around it and the ovary is stuck to my bowel. My gynecologist then referred me to a specialist for endometriosis. \n\nI had a letter since to say the biopsy confirmed endometriosis &amp; that it is severe. However, I've not had any further information up until this point. \n\nI went for the consultation today with the specialist. Firstly, they did not have any of the information from the surgery or the photos. The two hospital are merging, but still haven't with their IT system. My consultant said he had seen the surgery results though whilst at the other hospital, but openly admitted he has over 70 patients so he can't remember it exactly.\n\nHe then proceeds to explain how there is two options, either to have surgery or not. He had said if my symptoms are manageable with the contraceptive pill, then it may not be worth having the surgery. I explained I've had many issues with the pill (from causing vomiting to extreme mood swings). I agreed with his sentiment, but I had just filled out a form showing on a degree of 1-10 about all my symptoms, so it was quite clear that I haven't been managing. He didn't explicitly say that was the only option, but it felt like he was pushing that to begin with.\n\nHe then pulls up my previous MRI and reads the information from that, showing a 7cm cyst on one ovary and 3cm on the other - which is incorrect compared to the actual results of the surgery. I had to point out that the MRI was taken from before the surgery. He agreed, and then said OK we need to get a 2nd MRI. \n\nIt felt like he was then going to leave the conversation there, with him booking the MRI and seeing me in 3 months time. I have been very anxious for this consultation, because other than the surgery, its the first time I've had a face to face consultation. I ended up crying at this moment out of frustration. \n\nHe was OK with me for that part, and then explained via a diagram where abouts the endometriosis abrasions are between my ovary &amp; bowel. He explained that during the surgery they were unable to see how deep those abrasions will be, so they need the MRI to try to get as much information as possible. He told me that they would need the bowel specialist &amp; other specialist to look over the MRI too.  This is, according to him, because if I was to require bowel surgery, they need to work out the potential risk of me then requiring a stoma after the surgery. \n\n\nSo I now have to wait 3 months until my next consultation with him. I understand now why the MRI is now required. However, I partly feel angry, because if they were aware from the surgery that they needed this further information, why didn't they ask my permission for the MRI, instead of wasting time with this consultation. I may have expected too much from this consultation, but this process has been making my anxiety really bad. When I had the laparoscopy, I thought that was going to be the end of most of my issues and I could start returning back to normal life. \n\nI don't know if anyone would know from the UK, but if after the next consultation I wasn't happy with the specialist, would there be away to get a 2nd opinion from another endometriosis specialist? I'm not sure how any of this works. \n\nIf you made it to the end, thank you for reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/p7h9m6/not_sure_how_to_feel_following_consultation/"}

{"id": "Endo_l14u2z", "text": "I wanted to share my first robotic laparoscopic myomectomy experience (took place today) in hopes of calming anyone looking to get this surgery. The purpose of my surgery was to remove a massive fibroid and to clean up some endo. I have the standard five incisions but mine are higher up on the belly (nothing near hips). Not sure if that\u2019s the standard robotic ports but I assumed they\u2019d be slightly lower. \n\nI remember when I scheduled my surgery in November, I stopped sleeping and memorized every single post, tip, piece of advice etc found on both Reddit and Glow app. Long story short, it was nowhere near as scary as I made it seem. Below are some bullets of where I currently am, a day post-op. I know not all experiences are the same and I felt like I read the really complicated ones which was good because I felt prepared for it all. There are so many warriors on this channel and I, at best, feel like I\u2019m worthy of a participation trophy for my garden-variety experience. Here\u2019s a recap:\n\nSurgery prep: I read on Reddit that someone exercised and got into great shape before their procedure and I couldn\u2019t agree more that this has helped me the MOST. If you are able to, I highly recommend arm and leg workouts leading up to surgery. I\u2019m much more mobile because of it and am able to get around with only a bit of discomfort. \n\nAnxiety management: I have TERRIBLE anxiety. The weeks leading up to the surgery I was in rare form. What helped was organizing myself and creating \u201cstations\u201d throughout my house with Tylenol and things I felt like would be useful to me. I prepped the day before and it made me calm and somehow I slept through the night with no issues. \n\nPain level: completely manageable. I was prescribed opioids and OTC meds and have not even bothered looking at the opioids. I took two Tylenol and have been fine, and I took them about 8 hours apart and in that down time, I didn\u2019t feel much pain at all. The best way to describe it is as if you did a million crunches. I do feel my incisions though but it\u2019s not the worst. No cramping giving the amount of work that was done to my uterus so I\u2019m wondering if I got a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card on this one. \n\nCar ride home: I looked like the Michelin man with all the pillows I had but didn\u2019t feel any discomfort at all (I live in NYC where there\u2019s a pothole every 3 inches). Great to have padding between seatbelt and your belly though. \n\nGas pain: I haven\u2019t met any gas pain (yet). Some brief twinges of gas here and there in my shoulder but completely manageable. I also walked a lot after surgery and have been farting up a storm (sorry tmi)\n\nScars: will update this eventually but I got 5 incisions - 4 on my upper belly and one in belly button. I was very worried my career as a bikini model would be over (joking) but it\u2019s really not that bad. This was a concern of mine and was upsetting me but it\u2019s really not a big deal. I\u2019m actually proud of these scars and am so excited to finally not look so bloated all the time!\n\nAppetite: I was worried I wouldn\u2019t eat but I have appetite and ate a turkey sandwich at the hospital. I have anti nausea meds, haven\u2019t used them (hopefully won\u2019t). I did have anti-nausea meds in my IV drip and I think that helped. \n\nMobility: slow and steady wins the race. The rumors are true, it SUCKS to get up and down but walking is fine for me since my cuts are centered around my upper belly, I feel like I can lean on my lower belly a bit more. \n\nSleeping: can\u2019t sleep on my back and am definitely a stomach sleeper hence why the long post at 3am EST. :-) I know that this too shall pass. \n\nSome random call outs:\n- no bowel movement yet and frankly I am terrified given how tender everything is.

Good riddance, fibroid weirdo!!!\n- My surgery ended up being longer than expected and was down for 5 hours - that said, my body was not waking up fast enough afterwards and I needed a Foley catheter to void. I didn\u2019t go home with one though and have been urinating normally. This was my top fear and it was realized and I was pleasantly surprised at how... fine it was. Yes, it sucks to a degree but it\u2019s so fast that it is not even a big deal. I found a uterine biopsy to me more painful but that\u2019s just me!\n- I was terrified of anesthesia. This was my first surgery and going under was so scary to me. Anesthesiologists are incredible people and I cried when I met mine and she immediately gave me a \u201cmargarita\u201d and next thing I know, I\u2019m waking up to a turkey sandwich. \n- What I found to be The Worst about this is the anxiety and fear of the unknown. The nerves before the surgery were worse than anything else. I reminded myself, \u201cwhat matters most is how well you walk through the fire\u201d\n\nIf you have any other questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.

I haven't gone to any specialist about it, just my GP and hospital visits. \n\nWhen I had my IUD inserted (removed now), pretty soon after I had very intense left sided pelvic pain, I went to the hospital and they told me my left fallopian tube inflamed, and that the IUD strings gravitated into my uterus. I had no infection, my blood work came back great, and so they did more ultrasounds a few days later and the swelling went down. Desperate, I begged for a course of antibiotics, I obviously had it removed, but the pain never subsided. All my ultrasounds come back as healthy. \n\nThe pain feels more like an irritation now, maybe a dull tight pain you could say. Sometimes it's worse than other times, and it almost feels like it radiates down my leg. I need to massage around my inner hip bone and shake my leg hard and fast to relieve it when it's bad. \n\nIt feels like the inner pelvic muscles around my left fallopian tube are all very, very tense and spasmed almost, and constantly by the way. It never is fully relaxed, it just varies in intensity. Sometimes it's just a dull pressure I can ignore, other times it drives me crazy to the point I've even gotten drunk to just relax my muscles and get my mind off of the tightness and discomfort. \n\nAny thoughts anyone can share that could help would be life changing for me.

{"id": "Endo_p2h1ht", "text": "Hey all. I was diagnosed with endometriosis though surgery back in 2010. I had an exploratory lap done and then a few weeks after that had an ablation done. Then I had another ablation done in 2012. I have not had many issues with it since then, managed to get pregnant in 2019 and had a (mostly) uneventful pregnancy and gave birth to my son at the end of 2019. However since giving birth to my son, it seems like my endo has gotten worse with recurring pain. It's usually not bad and I can power through it, and I'll have instances of pain that last for a few straight days and then go weeks or months without pain. I had an IUD placed back in November of 2020 and have not had any issues with it.\n\n Here within the last month, month and a half I have had such bad pain. I've had the positioning of my IUD checked twice via digital manipulation and via ultrasound and I've been told it's perfect. The pain is constant. hovering around 5-6/10 and sometimes as bad as 8/10. It doesn't favor either side but sometimes I do get pain in my lower back with it as well. The pain in my back is lower than where I had my epidural so I know it isn't residual back pain from my delivery, and I'm not sure why I would have pain this far out from that when I never had any issues with it before. The back pain only comes when the pain in my pelvic area ramps up. Sometimes it gets so back I can't breathe or speak. \n\nThe last time I went to the doctor, they told me to take ibuprofen prophylactically, even after I already told them I had been taking ibuprofen and naproxen constantly for my migraine headaches and it was beginning to make my stomach hurt AND it wasn't doing anything for my pain levels, and to try a course of antibiotics because \"we don't know why but sometimes it helps\". Well, I'm almost finished with the course of antibiotics and so far it hasn't done jack. The pain is worse now than when I scheduled the appointment, and I'm having bloating so bad I feel like I'm going to pop. When I was at the doctor, I asked what the next step was after trying the course of antibiotics and they said that it was likely an exploratory lap to see if there was any recurrence of endo.\n\nI do not want to have surgery. I have a very active lifestyle and a very active almost 2 year old who demands my attention and I cannot be laid up in bed for 6-8 weeks recovering. My husband is very busy and stressed at work and I cannot put the burden on him to take care of the household while I'm recovering from surgery. On top of all that, we're in the process of trying to buy a house and surgery would severely delay that as well. \n\nAll I want is to not be in pain any longer, or at least return the pain to a tolerable level like it was before. I want to be able to have more days without pain than with pain. I want to be able to have sex with my husband without having a week, week and a half, two week recovery period afterwards because the pain is so bad. I know from prior experience that surgery is not going to make this much better, and even if it was going to, I just can't make the time for the reasons mentioned above.\n\nI don't know if my doctor thinks I was drug-seeking and this is the reason they chose to recommend surgery over narcotics, but is there something special I need to do or say to get them to prescribe prescription pain medication? I already use CBD and delta 8 and it doesn't do much for my pain either. I use delta 8 every night before bed for sleep. Last night I smoked a lot before bed and was having an instance of 9/10 pelvic pain and the D8 didn't touch it.

It was six months to the follow up appointment after a tonne of cancellations, to which point I had quite bad rectal bleeding, at which point I was told it absolutely  could not have been endo. \n\nCue a bunch of gastro appointments with them not finding any bleeding.

It was out of curiosity more than anything, as prior to the post I had never really considered that Endometriosis could be an issue for me. Peoples responses however made me wonder if Endometriosis was really the cause of my issues after all of these years..\n\nWell, I too was completely blindsided by my diagnosis just two weeks ago today, and I wanted to share my story and how I got to the point of diagnosis in hopes that it will help any other woman.\n\nBackground:\n\nAround 2015 I developed digestive issues. Bloating to the point I looked 8 months pregnant, diarrhoea one day and constipation the next, but it kind of happened in waves and didn't cause too much grief. I was on the birth control pill at this time and continued having 'flare ups' of these digestive issues for another 2 years before it really started bothering me. \n\nI eventually decided in December 2017 that I would go off the pill because I'd read a few research papers that indicated it could've been the pill making me feel this way. By this point I was in a serious relationship and we used condoms and tracked my cycle in order to be safe and not have any accidents now I wasn't on the pill. For about 12 months I would say my digestive symptoms settled. I definitely still felt off some days, but overall it wasn't affecting my life too much and I thought I'd gotten to the bottom of the problem.\n\nFast forward to beginning of 2019 my bloat and bowel movements were back and causing horrendous pain. I booked in to see a naturopath and she was a god send - she really helped minimise my symptoms and regulate my bowel movements, and overall I just felt the best I'd felt in years. By this point I had been diagnosed with IBS and lactose/gluten intolerance, so that is what we were trying to manage with vitamins/diet etc. I still flared up very often - bloating more than anything. \n\nCome to March 2020, my husband and I were ready to start trying for a baby. I'd been off the pill all these years, so we just got straight to it. I was tracking my cycle by taking my temperature every morning, doing ovulation tests, timing our sex during my fertile days perfectly. Month after month passed and no pregnancy. I started feeling like something wasn't right and after trying to conceive for 7 months I went to an OB/GYN. \n\nI am so grateful for my doctor that despite not trying to conceive for 12 months was willing to send me for a HyCoSy tubal patency test. This lead to the discovery that both of my Fallopian tubes are completely blocked. My doctor was lead to believe I had Endometriosis and we needed to do a Laparoscopy ASAP. Within two weeks I was having my surgery.\n\nMy doctor discovered Endometriosis all throughout my pouch of Douglas (explains years of bowel issues!!!!) and over my left and right uterosacral and round ligaments. As suspected, my Fallopian tubes are also completely scarred shut with Endometriosis.\n\nI am heartbroken. My lifelong dream of becoming a mother will only become a reality after enduring IVF, and I am devastated I was showing these digestive symptoms for so many years, that we now know was Endometriosis riddling my insides and causing my infertility.\n\nI never thought it could've been Endometriosis because I never presented with any of the 'standard' symptoms. No heavy periods, no painful periods, no cramping, no irregular cycles. Absolutely nothing. My cycles were only 3-5 days long and if I didn't have to change my tampon I wouldn't even know I was on my period.\n\nThe difference I feel after my Endometriosis excision two weeks ago is incredible. I never thought I'd see the day I didn't bloat to the point of a full term pregnancy. I feel the best I've felt in over 5 years. \n\nIf any of this resonates with you, please advocate for yourself and listen to your intuition.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/ko8vu5/i_was_completely_blindsided_by_my_endometriosis/"}

I got a full hysterectomy with endo excision earlier this year so I am still healing, slowly but surely I hope. Alone in the exam room the doctor dismissed my pain, wouldn\u2019t review my chart when I told him I am already on narcotics daily for endometriosis, he then yelled at me \u201cno narcotics\u201d and stormed out of the room. I have never been yelled at like that by a man in a room before and it was terrifying especially given the vulnerable and painful state I was in. I truly only go to the ER when I can\u2019t take the pain anymore and my chart reflects that, it\u2019s not often that I need to go but typically whenever I get a virus my pelvic pain flares horribly. The ER denied my request for a different doctor who would actually review my chart so I left. I wrote a letter to the hospital to tell them of the incident and also informed them that I was in this position of having pain because after years of me going to the ER saying I was in pain and being told nothing was wrong by dismissive doctors when the whole time I had endometriosis causing damage which I am still trying to reverse and don\u2019t know if I will ever be able to.

They just don\u2019t have the knowledge or awareness of just how bad endometriosis episodes are when they are REALLY bad.

Like if I watched myself cut my own finger I'd probably cry from shock but if I chopped off my finger and didn't see I probably wouldn't even flinch tbh. \n\nSo when I have pain whether its period pain or flare up pains I can suppress it to the point where I look normal even though I'm biting my lips and rocking/bouncing/moving my body in some way because of how uncomfortable I am. But then sometimes it's so bad I'm on my knees vomiting, I'm crying, hyperventilating and genuinely trying not to scream. So when it's the latter and I'm on the verge of tears I feel like I'm faking it or like I'm being dramatic and i know its hard to believe someone is in pain when they're not visibly showing it. Like why are you like this? it can be way worse. Even though deep down I know I'm completely entitled to my pain whether its worse than the least or less than the worst. \n\nDidn't take pain meds today to remind myself why I take them and although I'm in pain now and I'm feeling crap I'm still thankful for the reminder of how much the meds help me to act normal and how much harder that is without them.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/pc4kuz/huge_imposter_syndrome/"}

I have depression and going to the hospital is kinda triggering for me right now, but I need advice if I should go or if it's normal. \n\nWell, first of all if I go I'll have to go with my dad and I just don't like. He's supportive and all but I feel very embarrassed talking to him about seeing a gynecologist, but I'll have to suck it up if I have to go. Not my idea of fun tho! \ud83d\ude29\n\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\n\nLast year, a 13-centimeter cyst next to the ovaries has showed up in my MRI and my gynecologist said she's pretty sure it's endometriosis. My CA-125 levels were high (480, I think? Haven't seen the reports in a while so idk if I'm getting the name of the test wrong) and I did other tumor marker tests too, all of them were normal.\n\nShe put me on birth control pills, told me that I'd have to get surgery, but I was really super depressed by that time so I stopped the treatment! \n\nAfter 2 months tho, the 13cm cyst decreased in size and the doc told me that although there's significant improvement, maybe I'd have to get the cyst biopsied? I didn't get it biopsied tho. She told me to do the cancer marker tests again, which I didn't do, because I didn't have money and I was suicidal too. I stopped having any abnormal symptoms tho. \n\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\n\nAnyways, so this month (11 months after the cyst thing) I **started my period around 22nd August.**  My periods are usually on time and last around 6-7 days. The same thing happened this time as well, I had them for 6-7 days and then they were over. \n\nAbout **two (ish) weeks after my period, I started having some discharge** -- always happens? Ovulation, I figured? -- and thought it would be okay in a few days. But the **amount of discharge was more than normal**?? It's happened to me though, there's so much discharge that my tummy starts hurting and hurts for days. This time, I had to change my undies every 2-3 hours because it would just ruin it all? I eventually started wearing pads for the discharge and wore them for 3-4 days. **The amount of discharge reduced after 4 days too, and I felt (unsure) that one day the color of the discharge was maybe pinkish/light brownish? but that was just one day!** I had a dull pain in the lower left side of my abdomen while I had the discharge. I also had a very low-grade fever for about 10 days with it! I just took some antibiotics and paracetamol.  \n\n\nI don't have either the pain or the fever now, but **today I spotted?** No periods, but spotting? Am I freaking out without any reason? Should I see a doctor for it? I've never spotted before periods, is that normal?\n\n\n*I'm sexually inactive and I do not take birth control pills.*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/ppay6a/is_it_normal_or_should_i_see_a_doctor_the_post_is/"}

I was just in for my annual and asked my OBGYN how to receive the diagnosis for endo. Being a poor college student, all of the scans and such seemed much outside my price range. I was wondering, without prying too much, how you all went about to get an official diagnosis, and what that diagnosis meant for you. I know it is probably worth getting diagnosed 100/100 so I have an explanation in paper as to why I feel the way I do. I know it is a progressive disorder, meaning it gets worse with time, too. My mom actually had to have surgery to get the endo scraped out, and the cysts taken out as well. Sorry if that isn't super scientific, but it's the dumbed down explanation of the surgery my mom gave me.

Oh, and the fact that I had my period for 102 consecutive days earlier this year. When I met with my surgeon for my consult, he looked over the chart from the gyno who referred me, asked a few more questions, confirmed that he definitely can tell I have PCOS, but also didn\u2019t think my cyst ruptures were traditional ovarian cyst ruptures. He said he was pretty positive I also have endo and that he would excise any he found while doing my hysterectomy.\n\nFast forward to a few hours ago when one of the gyno residents comes to my room to check in with me and fill me in on some of the details/findings of my surgery. When he got in there, my surgeon found unspecified adhesions on my left ovary, left tube, part of my colon, and my abdominal wall. But, as far as the findings available to the resident, no other active endo implants were found.\n\nObviously, the tissue and organs he removed will all be sent to pathology, so there\u2019s a decent chance the adhesions were caused by endo. \n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar, where endo would explain basically every dumb thing your body does, you have adhesions likely caused by endo, but you have no other implants?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/kvkq8j/adhesions_but_no_other_active_endo_implants_found/"}

{"id": "Endo_kwzpde", "text": "Hi all! I've been seriously suffering from endo for the past year and a half, but dealt with symptoms my whole life. I had surgery back in June, where some endo was removed from my pouch of Douglas, abdominal wall and below my uterus. As well, they removed a 5 ish cm hemorrhagic endometioma and my left ovary/ tube, which it was on. The surgeon also unstuck both ovaries from my abdominal wall.\n\nI woke up from surgery, feeling much less pressure on my organs, but much more pain elsewhere. I suddenly had pain between my vagina and anus, which radiated up into my tailbone. It's never stopped. I live at a daily 6, 5 on a really good day, out of 10 on the pain scale. My doctor's are finally listening to me, and I've got appts and tests on the books. But I've been struggling to manage my pain. I'll post what has and hasn't helped, but recently discovered acupuncture. \n\nIt's made a profound difference in my pain, and I've only had 2 appointments. Unfortunately, my insurance is out of network, (yay HMOs and the US healthcare system! \ud83d\ude44 /s) so it's all out of pocket, but worth every cent. The needles didn't hurt and I even got some hooked up to electrical stimulation! It was like a deeper TENS unit, it's absolutely wonderful. \n\nDuring the treatment, my pain was cut in half the first time and completely gone most of the second time. Yup. Today was my second appt and I felt like I was floating during treatment. I cried a couple happy tears. I also fell asleep a little, both times. Yo, I can't even fall asleep in my own bed! Once it's over and I stand up, the pain returns, but both times, at a 3, instead of a 6. The last treatment gave me the 3 days following, some of the most pain-lessened, energetic and happy days, I've had in a very long time. After that, the pain slowly returned, day by day. But I feel even better after treatment again today, so I'm hoping to get 4 good days out of this one. \n\nIt was not cheap, $145 first visit, $95 each after. Though where I go has packages; I bought 6 visits for $510. I'm going to try and submit the bills to my insurance and see if I can get reimbursed, as well. My husband and I have reached a point, where getting my health in order comes before all. I was about at a point where I didn't know if I could work much longer, or even drive. It broke my heart. This is 100% worth that money to me.\n\nI know this won't cure anything, but it does reduce inflammation and can help relax tense muscles over time. Plus, it keeps my pain manageable until I can get in with a different specialist in February, and hopefully more surgery soon after. If you can spare the money for 2 appointments, or think your insurance might cover it, just try it. It can't hurt.\n\nI also use (and like): baclofen, baclofen suppositories, cbd suppositories, cannabis, gabapentin, tramadol, kratom (not with the tramadol!), heated blanket \n\nI have not had luck with paxil for my pain (or mood), or ketorolac/torodol. NSAIDS in general cause agony on my stomach. Tylenol does nothing. I did 8 months of pelvic floor PT that helped to a point, and will begin seeing a pelvic pain specialist in February, as well. \n\nLove you all much and I hope you all have less pain tonight. \u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/kwzpde/acupuncture_is_amazing/"}

They diagnosed me with endo even before this because of the large endometrioma that the doctor found via trans vaginal ultrasound, but laparoscopic surgery is the only way to get a definite endo diagnosis.

Besides that, there was no other visible endo anywhere else. Good job body for making it easy for them, and for me. \n\nI woke up sore as all hell though. Was restless until my doctor gave me some actual painkillers. Motrin and Tylenol just don\u2019t do it for me. Gave me some extra for emergencies. The nurses and staff were extremely nice.

After a scan and some blood work, they said I was fine. Lymphnodes in my stomach were just swollen and it would go in a few days. It's been a bit over a year now and it's still here. I was 18 when I went, now 19. The pain has moved to my left side and the pain just makes me buckle over and cry. It's hard to do heavy lifting anymore and even walk for a long time. I had internal and external ultrasounds, ct scans with visuals, and blood work, but they see nothing except \"pelvic fluid\" and they suggested my eggs could be rupturing. I get excruciating period cramps and I was raised to basically man up and that it was normal (I don't see other teenage girls hunched over nearly throwing up and crying every month but that may just be me, eh?) And they don't seem to even want to help me further. I've never gotten a call back from an OBGYN and my personal doctor just told me to talk to them and that they can't do anything. I feel like giving up and that the pain is in my head, but I've talked to other people with endo and they had a lot of symptoms I'm talking about. My doctors won't listen to my concerns and I don't know how to make them listen.

In the days leading up to my lap, I was constantly on this sub reading all sorts of posts about the procedure because it helped me feel better, and I wanted to give someone else the same comfort if I could. \n\nYesterday, I had a laparoscopy with robotic excision if any endometriosis was found. My doctor told my fianc\u00e9 she anticipated the surgery would most likely be about an hour, but I ended up with a 4 hour surgery. I remember the nurse telling me how long I was out for and thinking they had to have found something for it to take that long. \n\nI didn\u2019t get to talk to my doctor afterward but she had a discussion with my fianc\u00e9 while I was in recovery. She told him that I had endo everywhere and she emphasized to him that given the extent of it, I will need more surgeries in the future. She said endo had caused significant damage to my uterus, and she tried to just excise those portions of it since a hysterectomy had not been discussed. My fianc\u00e9 said there was so much information that he couldn\u2019t remember exactly where they found it. My post-op appointment is in two weeks, so I am sure she will go over everything then and any treatment plans. \n\nI ended up with 4 incisions: one on my belly button, one on each side of my pelvis area, and one under my rib cage on the left side. When they wheeled me into the operating room, the anesthesiologist gave me a sedative so the last thing I remember is me telling the nurses to leave their party music on. I don\u2019t remember him telling me I was going to sleep or to count down. \n\nThe next thing I remember is waking up in recovery thinking I was at home, and I turned my head to look for my fianc\u00e9. Once I processed where I was, the first words out of my mouth were, \u201cOh yeah, I had surgery!\u201d \n\nThe recovery nurse asked about my pain, and I was at a 5 or 6 so she kept giving me pain meds until I felt comfortable. It honestly didn\u2019t feel nearly as bad as my worst period. I kept apologizing to the nurse because she was trying to talk to me and I kept falling asleep. \ud83d\ude02 The same thing happened with my post-op nurse, so luckily my fianc\u00e9 was there to listen to the discharge instructions. \n\nMy doctor is an angel, because she actually let all the gas out before I woke up. I had some shoulder pain but it\u2019s gone now. The trade off to this, however, is the freaking nausea. I think the combo of the hospital giving me pain meds on an empty stomach, the anesthesia, and the dye they used made me sick. Even after Zofran and a nausea patch behind my ear, I still vomited a lot yesterday. \n\nToday, I am just really sore and tired. Nothing unexpected given yesterday\u2019s events. I\u2019m just trying to stay on top of my pain meds, move a little, and rest/sleep. I did need my fianc\u00e9 to help walk me around yesterday. \n\nOverall, I can only feel immense gratitude for my doctor, the hospital staff, and my fianc\u00e9 for the incredible care I have been receiving. Everyone has been so kind and attentive, and yesterday could not have gone smoother. While it sucks that there are more surgeries in my future and this pain in my butt (sometimes literally) condition is now a lifelong companion, I feel lighter from the answers and validation. \n\nI hope this experience helps others who are getting ready for their first lap. \u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/ozacla/lap_recovery_update/"}

I\u2019ve been bleeding and cramping for a while now (first week after lap I was fine!).\n\nI had a CT scan on 2nd February because I was having severe bowel pain and was having rectal bleeding. The doctor noted my right ovary looked bulky and he could see I was still a little swollen from my lap/IUD and that it looked all normal. (He also found I was severely constipated which was causing pain!) I did a urine test and blood test which came back all normal. I was put on painkillers that were slightly stronger than ibuprofen, and also stool softener. Bowel pain went shortly after, but was still left with pelvic pain.\n\n\nThe past 2 weeks though, the pelvic pain has gotten worse and more frequent - called my surgeon who reassured me it can take up to 6 months to heal properly and it was probably all pain from my IUD. She asked me to come so she could do a quick internal ultrasound to reassure me and make sure the IUD was still in the right place.\n\nWent in today and although the IUD was in the right place, she found a 4cm blood filled cyst on my left ovary that wasn\u2019t their in surgery or in the CT scan. I was just shocked that something could grow that quickly in 2 weeks!!!\n\nShe\u2019s given me a course of hormonal tablets to take that should stop my bleeding, then induce a heavy bleed at the end of the course. She said that should get rid of it but has booked a follow up on 5 weeks time.\n\nShe also said my ovaries are naturally quite \u201cbulky\u201d and there was a very tiny small cyst on my right ovary during surgery (never mentioned that before...) what does a bulky ovary even mean!?\n\nI got home and napped because I was so wiped out, but later on got the most extreme abdominal pain I\u2019ve ever had in my life. I was so close to going to A&amp;E but I waited it out for 20 mins and it eased. I think it might have been to do with being prodded around inside by the internal ultrasound.\n\nAnyone else discovered a surprise cyst so soon after a lap/scan?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/lns4i3/cyst_found_on_ovary_shortly_after_laparoscopy/"}

I did have an h-pylori test to make sure I didn't have a stomach ulcer, and it came back negative, which means I don't.

I'd sort her water bottle when needed and spent most of the time reading up on the NHS' endo page \ud83d\ude05She was mostly guilty for being unable to do anything but I did my best to assure her not to be, I was there to help.\n\n*Generally, she was quite stubborn, which respect her for - especially with the condition - she wanted to do everything herself and would eschew my offers of help unless absolutely necessary.* \n\nThe second bout; when it first hit, she was at mine. I passed out in bed, she woke me up, asked me to run the watterbottle, I woke up in a daze and said I was too tired from my stress. She stormed home citing 'you can't be stressed, you sit on a PC all day (working)'\n\nThe relationship lasted another 3 weeks in which she never mentioned the endo. She certainly never stayed over whilst suffering.  She would say 'I feel ill'; 'I feel sick'. Moronic me took that at face value. I was offering help thinking she had a cold or a stomach bug, but never took it too seriously thinking 'it'll pass'. When I did offer to come over to bring food etc. she told me not to bother. She'd message me that she'd been up all night feeling 'sickly' or that she 'felt like death today' and I was too stupid to clock it was the endo.\n\nThat waterbottle night seemed to be a trigger that snowballed into her being scared/unwilling to communicate the endo directly.

I\u2019ve had the Mirena for a month. I got a Mirena after the pill than controlled my endo became N/A worldwide. Tried two other BCPs, with no luck. My main issue was uncontrolled, unexplained bleeding. When I bleed, the endo pain kicks in. So four weeks ago I had a D and C, laparoscopy and Mirena insertion (and LLETZ, but that\u2019s an unrelated procedure). The past two weeks, symptoms have kicked off quite intensely. I gained 3.5kg in a week and my entire body is swollen with water; boobs are huge and sore; my stomach and pelvis swell over the day and are sore to touch (can\u2019t wear my normal clothes); bleeding is increasing and heavier than before; the cramps are WAY worse than endo pain and constant; and now my skin is breaking out in acne and dermatitis. I know these symptoms are the Mirena, as I\u2019ve been on the same version of progesterone orally, three times this year. Things just keep ramping up. I have my check up on the 28th- 6 weeks post insertion. I feel like I\u2019ve managed to get every side effect! For those that reacted quite severely, how long did it take to settle? I\u2019ve now been bleeding since April, without much reprieve. I\u2019m almost 40 and would like to be able to leave the house without being scared I\u2019m going to bleed everywhere. The pill that worked is available through an emergency government exemption. I have no idea if I should stamp my feet and demand it\u2019s removal on the 28th; or if I just need to keep waiting. This has taken over my life, after twenty sweet years of being controlled.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/l0b5s3/mirena_is_worse_than_my_endo_how_long_do_i_need/"}

I was told to take ibuprofen and paracetamol and they gave me some mefenamic acid to try and stop the bleeding which didn't work.\n A year later I was given tranexamic acid and had the same outcome. \nA year after that, even through multiple appointments they finally listened and gave me co codamol but that didn't help the pain either.\n A few months later I started birth control and went through 6 types in one year because the pain progressed to diarrhoea, vomiting and fainting in pain every single month, I would get pain shooting through my labia and down my legs and up to my chest but again all I was offered was blood tests, mefanamic acid, tranexamic acid, birth control, co codamol, paracetamol and ibuprofen even though these hadn't worked in the past and the bloods always came back fine. \nThe next year they tried placing the blame on IBS, saying that the diarrhoea didn't coincide with my periods at all therefore it was an intestinal issue and to take IBS medication. It didn't work. \nThey then suggested the Mirena coil which I went for and the pain from the insertion felt so similar to my period pain that I knew that it wasnt intestinal pain that I was feeling. The coil worked for a few months but then I just ended up with a 3 month period and then shorter ones and then irregularity and then no pain for months.\nI finally felt normal again.\nSlowly the pain got worse. The diarrhoea and vomiting came back all for a period the size of a grain of rice. I was re referred to gynae and got put on a high fibre diet for 2 months. Later on I was dairy and gluten free for 3 months which achieved nothing and again proved it wasnt my gut. \nFinally I got taken semi seriously and they put me on a waiting list for a laparoscopy and my Pre Op is on August 20th with the laparoscopy hopefully in september.\n\nIt's been a nightmare of being told it's in my head and that it doesn't hurt and that it's my guts when I can see a correlation between pain and period but it's over.\nTo anyone that sees this that feels like giving up like I did at times, keep going. You know your body, you feel your pain. Do not let the doctors silence you. Your pain is not felt by them, they cannot say it's in your head, they cannot say it does not hurt and that you don't know what you are feeling.\n Keep pushing them to find out what's wrong, follow the diets to disprove the IBS theories, do the blood tests, but don't accept it when they discharge you. \n\nThey can find out what's wrong with you if you keep pushing on.

(First time getting my period on the pill in years, had an IUD for 2 years and the implant for over a year). She said it\u2019s still possible to have endometriosis and pcos. So I just wanted to know if anyone else has both and how you got diagnosed with both? \nI guess I\u2019m just wondering if the painful periods continue if I should push for a lap. My endocrinologist said that pcos shouldn\u2019t cause pain.

What I didn't know was that it also contained a full list of my medications back to 1998. The first item on there, from when I was TWELVE YEARS OLD was mefanamic acid for period pain. August 1998 was when it was prescribed.\n\nTwenty three years ago I started with all this. The rest of the list (50+ different medications) can be divided into four categories: pain relief; antibiotics for BV, thrush, UTIs; bowel medications (I've found out my bowel is encased in adhesions with my ovaries attached); and anxiety medication (because I was told the bowel problems and abdominal pain was all in my head).\n\nWhy oh why didn't anyone ever think hang on.... there's something wrong here. For any other UK women looking to get a good look at their medical history, I definitely recommend downloading the app. I'm now gonna request my full medical history; tbh I'd forgot all the individual doctors visits, but put together they paint a clear picture.

{"id": "endometriosis_mi68qc", "text": "Hello! My mom and grandma both had endo, so I always assumed it was in my future. Always had super heavy/painful periods and just dealt with it. \n\nThen last year, I started having consistent acid reflux/GI issues that I mostly just dealt with. Fast forward to Labor Day and I had the worst pain I\u2019ve ever had just above my belly button along with vomiting. Went to the ER and they told me it was an ulcer and sent me home. \n\nFast forward again to Oct 30th and the pain was back with a vengeance. My mom found me on the bathroom floor and rushed me to the hospital. They actually did some tests (amazing, right?) and determined I had inflammation in my small intestine. That was Friday. On Monday, I was in for emergency surgery. They removed part of my small intestine and sewed me back up. BUT while they were in there, they discovered a ton of endo scar tissue that had caused the issue in my intestines. \n\nSince then, I\u2019ve had good days and bad days. For a while, I attributed that to the healing process. But the last couple of months, it\u2019s constant. Constant non-localized pain, indigestion, fatigue, diarrhea, etc. I have appointments lined up this month to get to the root source, but I can\u2019t help but feel (especially after reading so many posts in here) that my symptoms are endo related. \n\nRight now, a heating pad 24/7 is the only thing making life bearable. Like I said, it\u2019s not pain in a specific spot. And it\u2019s not nausea like when you have the flu or food poisoning. It\u2019s just a general tightness, gurgling, unease that\u2019s constant in my abdomen. And I\u2019m spotting when I\u2019m not even in my period, which makes me even more confident it\u2019s the endo. \n\nAnyone else experience anything like this?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/mi68qc/symptoms_0_to_100/"}

{"id": "endometriosis_mwu0s1", "text": "Hi all, As a bit of background: \n- I was diagnosed via laparoscopy back in 2013 and have managed my pain using various different BCs.\n- I started taking mefenamic acid about three years ago to combat the pre menstrual migraines I would get two days before my bleeding started. \n- currently have a nexplanon implant as BC which is technically at the end of its life now and needs changing but can't currently because of covid and it isnt classed as an emergency. \n- I'm in the UK\n\nSo this is a question about recent pain. \n\nThe past year or two I've had some really unpleasant first day of bleeding pains. It's happened maybe 6 or so times from memory but honestly my memory is awful. But it happened today and it was so awful it prompted me to write this. \n\nOn the first day I am due to start bleeding (but not on every period) I have noted that I will have the most intense flank/kidney pain (pain radiates from the lower back where kidneys are located around the sides but not around my front). It will generally come on very quickly and rapidly get worse to the point of me almost passing out. It makes me dizzy and nauseous and I often need to sit as scrunched up as possible to make it even just about bearable. It lasts less than five minutes and then the bleeding usually starts immediately after the pain has subsided. It feels like menstrual cramps but in the wrong place if that makes sense? And more intense.\n\nPrior to these attacks (for want of a better word) I would have a two day migraine and the bleeding would start immediately after the migraine subsided. When this kidney pain happens it is in conjunction with the migraine usually. So I'm guessing it's all linked. I've never had kidney issues before and I don't get pain or issues at any other time outside of this first day of bleeding. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is it likely to be endometrial cysts even if it isn't happening with every period? \n\nObviously will go straight to doctor about this as it's happened enough times to not be a one off infection or something. But just wanted some input from anyone who has had similar? \n\nThank you all x", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/mwu0s1/kidneyflank_pain_first_day_menstruating/"}

{"id": "Endo_pkzew3", "text": "Hey, I just got my first IUD put in, and I\u2019m wondering if these are normal or strange things. I was described the pain would be like period cramping. Considering I\u2019ve not had a period in a very long time, and the one I had was so disabling it was basically like knives not leaving my gut, occasionally twisting, all my school work done in that time of lower quality, I could say don\u2019t know what an average \u201cperiod cramp,\u201d is like. \n\nBut the IUD is fairly awful. Maybe not that level of awful, but pretty bad. Occasionally very sudden spikes of pain will shoot through me, causing me to double into myself. As if curing over in pain, if I were standing up. They stay, and cramp up, in sort of waves. Sometimes I\u2019ll lay down with heat and wait for them to fade. I don know if the heat is helping, but over time they get less bad and I can focus, and then eventually may fade fully. But eventually, in who knows how long, they might come back. What\u2019s odd though, is if my period level pain was a 9 (I always assumed 10 was literally dying), this is still a pretty solid 7? \n\nAnother thing that I don\u2019t know if it is related or not, is that I\u2019ve been having issues with my dizziness. I have another disability, Vasovagal Syncope, so it could just be that, and we have an appointment for it, but lately, every time I stand up, sometimes even just shifting to sitting, I get so dizzy. And standing fully can make me pass out if I\u2019m not careful. But what\u2019s off is how often it has been happening. Practically every time I stand.

{"id": "endometriosis_o94lqw", "text": "Hi everyone. This is me asking for advice really, but I failed to do this without ranting thus marked it as so just in case.\n\nA few years ago I had an ovarian cyst burst, had an immediate surgery to remove the cyst, got diagnosed with endometriosis and started taking birth control pills. Plus I had hormone problems - around that same time I had a lot of really bad acne, dark hair on my arms and all of that stuff.\n\nAt first I was put on Yarina and a 10-day course of hormones, it was terrible, I could barely get up that month so I quit as soon as the pack was finished (then my period wouldn't stop, but my doc gave me a treatment to fix it). After that I did a blood test to check Yaz+ compatibility, and ever since then I've been taking it. Thank God, it seems to help.\n\nThe only problem is that gradually after starting Yaz+, I started having weird flu-like symptoms. My on-going theory for this has to do with lactose in Yaz+ ingredients - I'm not intolerant in the traditional sense, but when I was a teenager, I discovered by accident that going off dairy clears up my acne. I stopped eating dairy and after a few years, I started noticing that if I do accidentally eat something with dairy in it, I wake up with a sore throat or my nose being stuffed. I still don't eat dairy, but after beginning Yaz+ I started to get sick in the summer, I'm hysterically scared of any wind or AC becaue it resuts in something like sinusitis (at first during the winter I couldn't even ride in the car or be in certain buildings because the \"headache\" was so bad). Clearing out my sinuses and being on a very strict healthy diet helped with this, but I'm still not doing things like a normal person - leaving all windows open gave me a headache at +39 degrees celsius just now, which is hilarious. I can't go into grocery stores in the summer without a hood. It should be noted naturally my immunity system was a bit weak in my teenage years, but before Yaz+, I distinctly remember doing stuff like sitting next to an open window for the whole night at -20 degrees Celsius and having no problems with the flu.\n\nSo, considering there seem to be no birth control pills without lactose in them, is there something that could be done? Any alternatives to keep endometriosis and cyst growth at bay? One of the docs told me if I stop, the old symptoms would come back, but I don't know. Sorry for a LOT of text, really sorry, but I'd be very appreciative of any advice or thoughts on this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/o94lqw/birth_control_side_effects_are_there_alternatives/"}
{"id": "endometriosis_mrizc3", "text": "Hello all, first time poster here.\n\nSo I recently went to see a gyna for some issues I\u2019ve been having, namely: mid-cycle bleeding that I believe is linked to ovulation that started three months ago, blood clots almost as big as my palm the last two cycles, and left sided pelvic pain. I also get horrible lower back pain and upper abdominal pain, probably unrelated. I pee often and my bowel habits are so irregular. I\u2019ve always had heavy, painful periods, and I\u2019ve never thought twice about them. \n\nI had been really worried about something horrible like ovarian cancer, but I had a pelvic/vaginal ultrasound and they found nothing. No cysts or fibroids. My endometrium was thick but I was 1 day from starting my period and it was within the normal size for that. There was a small amount of free fluid but the doctor said that was probably related to a cyst that burst during ovulation and that it\u2019s normal, and wasn\u2019t concerned at all. When I explained everything, she said it sounds like endometriosis. She offered birth control and a pill for it, which I want nothing to do with. I\u2019m trying to get pregnant and don\u2019t want to just cover up/medicate an issue I don\u2019t even know I have..\n\nShe said if I tried those things, then I could come back and we could discuss maybe doing a lap, but that\u2019s so fucking infuriating because if I have it, I want it cut out! And we want to have a baby, so BC is really counterproductive. I have insurance the required referral to any specialist from my doctor so I can\u2019t just self-refer to another doctor.. and based on the reaction from the doctor, saying they try not to do surgery to cut it out because of the risks when I\u2019ve read that excision is the gold standard made me lose a lot of trust in them.

Growing up, even gynecologists ignored me and waved me away every single time I mentioned it.\n\nSeemed everyone assumed I was exaggerating, or just being an oversensitive pansy.

I saw a specialist a few weeks ago about my severe endo and adeno and what treatment would be best. And she said my bowel is stuck to my uterus and ovary on the left side? (is this even possible?) and since my ovary is really really large because of endometrioma that's about 8 or 9 cm I will need surgery. I have kissing ovaries as well. So 2 endometriomas that kiss and organs glued together. \n\nShe said she isn't convinced I have deep endometriosis in my bowel. But it is stuck to organs. Other hospital said I do have bowel DIE. But I saw the current one for a  3rd opinion (I've seen a few and now need to decide where I'm going to get my surgery) and she thinks otherwise. \n\nThis pain started in the morning a couple of weeks ago. It was ovary pain but noticed it only acted up as I needed the toilet. And once I used the toilet in the morning this stinging nagging shooting pain disappeared. But since a couple of days it's a constant pain. There are no breaks anymore. It's shooting and stinging and painmeds don't help at all. It's a throbbing kind of pain that lasts about 5 secs and then dissappears for about 2 secs and then comes back. All day long. I switch between constipation and diarreah. \n\nIs this my bowel being stuck to an organ? It's only on the left side. So it can't be appendicitis. It'd not connected to my ovulation or period. It's just constant nagging shooting pain. Heating pad doesn't help, meds don't help. It's making me restless!!! Is this an endo type of pain?

It lasted for what felt like hours and the only reason I didn't go to hospital was I had just moved to Canada and didn't have Healthcare yet. \n\nSince that occurrence, it has gone from once every few months, to once a month, and so on until now it feels like it can happen at any time (but 9 times out of 10 its either before or after emptying my bladder).\n\nIts in the dead center of my pelvic region, right above my public line, but the pain can radiate down into my vulva and rectum. Its severe enough that I double over, and I have to force myself to walk to a comfortable place instead of collapsing where I am. I have to employ what is basically lamaze to get through the initial wave.\n\nI have general pain and sensitivity in the same low center area on a daily basis, but when an abdomen attack (that's what I call them) happens I am extemely, extremely sore for 24-48 hours after. My abdomen hurts to the touch, and heating pads and weed have NOTHING on how it feels. My regular pelvic pain is a vacation compared to this.\n\nI ask this now because, well, I just had one at 4am after peeing. It took about 25 minutes to breathe though the worst of it which is average. When it happens I seriously just spend the first minute or so trying desperately to get things in order enough to collapse on the bed to ride it out.\n\nThe only patterns I've noticed are:\n1) in 2017 when my pain first worsened, it was always timed with ovulation \n2) since then it has become possible during any urination at any non-bleeding time in my cycle\n3) occasionally it happens after simply turning over in bed or in a chair, but when that's the case my bladder is always full, and I have to rush to empty it in case I'm down for a few hours\n4) it has, maybe two or three, happened after a bowel movement, but the pain I usually associate with BMs on a daily basis is nowhere near this degree.

For 2 years I was off of the pill, due to my insurance situation. During those two years I had some of the worse periods of my life, as well as the symptoms that follow. Major Fatigue, bloating, severe back pain, severe pelvic pain, cramps so bad they would wake me up out of a solid sleep. Constipation. Pain during intercourse, so bad having to stop. Clotting, bleeding through multiple pad and tampons, having to miss work, or go in late or come home to change clothes from bleeding through. No amount of OTC pain relief helps, heating pad doesn\u2019t help, diet did not help much. I stay constantly bloated, nothing I do seems to help the bloat. I expressed these concerns to my GYN at my annual, which also caused a number of issues within itself (severe cramping, and pain up inside, along with clotting) and he sent me for a vaginal and transvaginal ultrasound. Went to follow up today, everything normal.

The journey that led to an endometriosis diagnosis started with an ovarian torsion (basically my right ovary flipped twice on itself + the Fallopian tube), which was back in August. It was caused by a cyst that I had no idea was even on my ovary. In October, the surgeon went in again to remove the cyst. The cyst came back from testing as being an endometrioma and there were other things (I think fibroids and scar tissue from my uterus) that my surgeon also had tested, this lead to my diagnosis of mild endometriosis in mid to late November. \n\nMy pain began right after my ovarian torsion and has continued since, most of it being on my right side but it's always fluctuating in location and pain level. I just was put on birth control again for pain management and also hopefully avoiding another cyst. I haven't been on birth control long enough to see any effects so I'm not looking to replace it but, in my research on endometriosis I also saw an anti-inflammatory diet may help with symptoms and potentially CBD.

I was on hormonal birth control previous to that and I hated the side effects and how emotional it made me feel. I was ready for heavier periods and more cramps because of copper IUD as long as it wouldn't make me an emotional mess.\n\nDuring these 4 years, I have experienced heavier flow and very painful periods with cramps starting a week before my period and often a week after. I always thought that pain is caused by copper IUD and didn't pay much attention to other symptoms.\n\nAbout a year ago I have noticed that I would get pelvic pain after orgasms. It was odd, but I wasn't too concerned as I thought it was caused by muscle contractions?? I would often get bloated and constipated too, which was very uncomfortable and cause pelvic pain when I'm not on my period. Maybe 6 months later, I have also started noticing very light pink discharge about a week before and after my periods. Around 3 months ago I started experiencing a lot of deep pelvic pain during sex and also noticed some pink spotting/discharge on the sheets after that.\n\nI have called a sexual health clinic and got an appointment with a doctor, I was convinced that there might be an issue with my IUD. I've got tested for STI and got an internal examination and was told that my IUD is in place. Doctors diagnosis was - pelvic inflammatory disease, she was convinced that there's is an infection and prescribed me antibiotics before getting my test results. I start the course and get my results back, which are all negative.. I go back in two weeks because I'm still in a lot of pain despite not being on my period. All I've got was advice to contact my GP.\n\nI call my GP on the same day and have a phone doctor appointment (due to covid). The lady on the phone doesn't ask many questions and says she's going to refer me to a gynaecologist at one of the hospitals and just tell me to wait for them to get back to me. A week later I'm still having pelvic pain and nothing back from my medical practise or a gynaecologist.\n\nAt this point, I'm freaking out a bit. I start thinking it might be cancer and I've never had a smear test. My mum starts telling me about women in the family with a history of cervix cancer, fibroids and removed ovaries and endometriosis. I call my medical practice and this time I get another doctor on the line who was very attentive and told me to come in to see her in an hour. She does an internal examination and says that my cervix doesn't look like there's anything concerning like cancer, takes a swab for a smear test but also says that there is something else because I found the whole procedure quite painful. Of course, I will get my final smear test results in about a week so it might be anything.. The doctor made me another urgent referral to gyno for an ultrasound which will happen 2 week period.\n\nNOW, I know that I don't have a final diagnosis yet, but I think that I'm most likely to have endometriosis because my mum has it and was experiencing very similar symptoms when she was my age. At this point, I'm wondering if getting my copper coil replaced with Mirena would make a difference? Or a pill would best to go on the pill? The doctor at the sexual health clinics said that copper IUD might be causing flares up if I have endometriosis but I didn't ask about the alternatives..\n\nSorry about such a long rant, it's been a bit of an emotional rollercoaster!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/jtnm66/does_it_sound_like_endo_and_would_mirena_iud_make/"}

I explained that the discharge summary was misleading and said \u201cendometriosis was found and ablated\u201d bc they only ablated two sites out of the five that they found lesions in.

Last January I was admitted to hospital because I had (another) thunderclap headache with some distressing neck pain, so they very reluctantly admitted me to have a spinal tap to check for an aneurysm. They botched the procedure and got blood in the sample so they said they couldn\u2019t determine if there was blood in my CSF, even though I know that\u2019s a lie and you CAN test the sample to differentiate between fresh and old blood from an aneurysm etc. But they literally just discharged me? Like, you might have had an aneurysm so we have to do a spinal tap to say we followed procedure, tho we fucked it up, but at least we did it so you can go now bye\u201d ???????? And then like a year later I had a third CSF leak through my nose which was bright canary yellow which literally can only mean blood in the CSF.

It's gonna be a long one but I want to explain my situation as I don't know what the next step is and my gyno office is anything but useful right now.\n\nI had my first kid at 27 - naturally convinced and when he was 3, we decided to start trying for another kid. Conception was hella fast the first time around so I didn't have any concerns.\n\nWell, we tried for a year and a half, failed, and then last year we did micro-inseminations for a few rounds and they failed.\n\nI got the HSG test and my fertility doctor (first one) told me I had \"unexplained\" infertility. And recommended IVF.\n\nLast year November I was supposed to start IVF but I ended up getting a nasty bladder infection that turned into months of undiagnosed pain.\n\nI had to put off IVF, for obvious reason, and figure out what was going on with me instead.\n\nAn ultrasound showed that I had kidney stones and would need to get a CT scan to see how to do treatment. You can't do IVF with that on the agenda, so.\n\nThis took up until last month due to my CT scan in March being cancelled due to Covid.\n\nMy CT scan showed a calcification of a cyst and I needed a follow up to check that everything was OK.\n\nThat was today.\n\nMy gyno says all the cysts are fine and then in passing as he slips out the thingie - he tells me that he sees scarring and I should get that checked out because he thinks I have endo.\n\nI didn't really have time to process.\n\nI've heard of it but wasn't super familiar. He then told me it is associated with heavy period pains/discomfort but I haven't had any?\n\nI don't even drink pain killers anymore during my period.\n\nRight, here is where I'm confused. What is the next step?\n\n1. I called my IVF doctor to set an appointment so he can check up on me and he told me that I needed to refer to an endo specialist first.... and only once I have confirmation of endo will he see me?\n2. Should I find an IVF clinic that'll actually give me the time of fucking day?\n3. There seems to be various schools of thought on this. Some people say don't do lap as it reduces your egg reserves and can hinder IVF results. Others say do lap as it increases your chances of IVF. \n\nIt seems like such a huge step to go from \"potential\" endo to invasive lap surgery on a \"might have\" without being checked up by someone who actually gives a fuck.\n\nHas anyone ever dealt with this?\n\nI was so happy yesterday thinking I'll be starting IVF soon.. only to have this hard, crushing reality thrust upon my shoulders :(\n\nThank you for reading and your assistance.

He then said at my post op appointment that he had burnt all of the Endometriosis that he could see. A hysterectomy was in my future. Which I knew because of my mothers history with the same issues. She had her hysterectomy at 39 years old. I just turned 37 in May. I recently went to a new gynecologist because my pain came back ten fold. Also before I saw this new doctor,  I went to a urologist because of bladder pain, utis, bladder pressure, and urgency. They did a CT of my bladder. The bladder itself was intact and normal. They did see possible Endometriosis in my pelvis area, and fibroids on my uterus. Concluding why I went to see a new gynecologist. He looked at my CT and suggested a vaginal ultrasound suspecting I may have adenomyosis along with Endometriosis. Following  my ultrasound I was diagnosed with Adenomyosis, Endometriosis, calcification of my right ovary, and small fibroids.  Which makes more sense because of the symptoms that present every month. Majority of the month I am dealing with very heavy periods, fatigue, bloating, back pain, pelvic pain, bladder pain, extreme mood swings, etc. I am scheduled for a hysterectomy on the 28th of July. Sadly enough I had to pretty much beg for it. Even with the new diagnosis. I just hope after the surgery my bladder issues will subside and of course all of the other pain. I cant even count on my hand how many times I have been tested for UTIs after I turned 18 years old. I feel as if some doctors just want to over look and medicate before doing any surgery.

I'm 30F, started being sexually active at age 28 after getting a Mirena IUD placed. Previously to that, I started my period early, at age 11-12, and always had regular, basically non-painful periods, although had trouble using tampons due to what I now know is probably a tilted uterus. About a year ago I had one weird instance of extremely painful cramps, like to the point of nausea and crying, after basically stopping my period after getting the IUD, and some pain during sex in the right side. I checked that the IUD was in place and all was well, and then kept having a persistent, sharp pain on my right lower abdomen that came and went. After ruling out appendicitis through an ER visit (lol), I got an ovarian cyst diagnosis that was later checked with a pelvic ultrasound and revealed to be...not ovarian cysts? But that the arm of my IUD was slightly perforating my uterine lining, so I had it removed, and the pain more or less went away. But then a few months later the pain started up on the same side, same place, accompanied by a bout of nausea (which is very unusual for me), bloating, and general loss of appetite. Does this seem like endo? I know I'll probably just have to ask for a diagnostic surgery to tell for real, but just wondered if this sounded like a potential set of symptoms to anyone.

{"id": "endometriosis_j9117v", "text": "Hello, community. I've long been a lurker but I decided to sign up and share some of my story.\n\ntl;dr: 3 surgeries, 2 of them excision and 1 with a community-respected excision specialist. Still in pain 1.5 year later. A rant.\n\nI had three surgeries within the span of a year and a half.\n\nThe first was to remove an endometrioma the size of a golf ball. The doctor wasn't a specialist and got extremely offended when I was skeptical of Lupron post-op. Before surgery, I was begging for a hysterectomy because the bleeding and cramping was absolutely unbearable. The doctor actually laughed in my face and made jokes. Once they were visibly annoyed with me declining Lupron, I decided to move on.\n\nThe second surgery was with a self-declared excision specialist. I couldn't find anything about them on endo facebook groups, but they said all the right things during the consultation. After surgery, I was diagnosed with stage 4 DIE and heard, \"I did a great job!\" Within two months, I was having pain again and when I went back to this surgeon, they told me I had a mental problem and I shouldn't follow up with any other doctor or specialist. Once again, I decided to move on.\n\nThe third surgery was with a highly respected excision specialist. I read so many glowing reviews and could see from the content they posted online that they seemed extremely knowledgeable and competent. Again, I woke up in post-op to being diagnosed with stage 4 DIE and heard the same thing, about how they did a great job and how my life would be wonderful now. Within a month and a half, I was back in the ER with debilitating pain and a sizable ovarian cyst. I reached out to the surgeon, was told I would receive a call back, and never got one. The doctor who was treating me at the time also reached out. Nothing. Worth noting, I asked for a hysterectomy with this surgeon because of the ridiculous bleeding/cramping and was told there was nothing wrong with my womb.\n\nBleeding and in pain, I limped into a new doctor's office. I was given birth control which did nothing to stop my bleeding or pain. I was then put on Orilissa, which also did nothing except make me intolerant to heat all the time. Back on the birth control after that wasn't working, the doctor then recommended a Mirena, which I didn't go for because I can't imagine how much that would hurt, and physical therapy.\n\nI've been taking the birth control for months to try to avoid getting a period, and yet I still have pain and breakthrough bleeding. Truthfully, yes, my pain is different from before the third surgery. It isn't as intense every morning, but I'm literally sitting here at 3AM writing this with stomach pain and ridiculous bloating so I think it's worth venting about. I'm so tired of being dismissed by medical professionals and yet I dismiss my feelings too.\n\nI feel like such a fluke, though. I don't think the last surgeon I dealt with is incompetent, though I'm very let down that I still have endo pain and other symptoms. I still doubt what I'm even going through. How could someone have two excision surgeries (one with someone who has had so many successes) and just...still be in pain? I don't get it. I hate this disease.\n\nMy friend recently had a great success with a doctor for a different reproductive health issue. I'm going to visit this practice soon and I'm hoping I can be helped too. Taking birth control gives me anxiety and makes me feel awful so...on to the next one. Maybe I can finally be a success for once in my life? Who knows. At least this doctor is in network.\n\nThank you very much for reading. &lt;3 Please stay strong and safe.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/j9117v/pain_still_present_after_2_excision_surgeries/"}

I've tried hormonal ones, and those ruined my mood. Even made me suicidal. So last year, I got the paragard. I've since found out that that can I've endo symptoms worse, so it wasn't the best idea. Well two weeks ago, I went to the place I got it, so I could get a yearly exam and also talk to someone about the endo like symptoms I've dealt with all my adult life. I only talked to a nurse, but she was great. She listened to me, told me it might be endo without me even bringing endo up. She ordered an ultrasound to rule out other stuff and mentioned possible lap surgery later on if needed. When she did the exam, she noticed my iud was expelling. Tried taking it out, but stopped cuz she had resistance and wanted a doctor to try.\n\nLast week, I had my ultrasound. Today, I had the appointment with the doctor to talk about the ultrasound and my symptoms and get the iud taken out. I was so hopeful cuz the nurse was so great. She told me there were some things for endo that weren't hormones, if that's what was eventually determined that I had. But this doctor today was terrible! I feel like I got beaten and all my hope is gone. She did take my iud out with no issues, which is the only good thing about the visit. She tried implying that my symptoms would be gone now that she took it out, even tho I tried explaining that it started long before getting it. She said the ultrasound was clear, and she didn't seem concerned with finding out why I'm in so much pain. I mentioned the nurse mentioned possible endo, which the doctor agreed, but she didn't care about finding out if that's what's wrong. She asked what I would do about contraception now and really pushed hormonal birth control. She even ordered a mirena, and she said hormones are the \"only treatment\" for endo, if that's even what I have. Even tho I explained that hormones have affected my moods so terribly that it's made me suicidal, she still pushed hormones. \"Well, everything is different, and maybe you'll react differently now that you're older.\" This isn't some minor slightly annoying side effect. This is suicide! This is life threatening! I have bipolar, so i have enough issues with my mood as it is. I refuse to take anything that's going to make it worse. Maybe that's why I react like that with hormones, cuz of my bipolar? I don't know.

I'm so frustrated tho, and I feel hopeless. It seems like every time I see a doctor about anything, they're really dismissive and don't listen to me and push treatment I don't want. This has happened with psychiatrists too. I don't know what to do. I know a lot of doctors give hormones for endo, but when the nurse said about other possibilities, so I was hopeful. I'm terrified of hormones now, and I refuse to take them. I'm not saying they're always bad. They do help people. But they've never helped me, they've only made me worse. So I have no idea what to do. If I keep finding doctors who are dismissive like this and keep pushing hormones on me, idk what to do.

{"id": "Endo_fiyk26", "text": "Ended up in hospital around 2.30pm today (I\u2019m writing this as of 9.50pm Sunday night) because of a very excruciating endo flare. I had been very sick and throwing up over the last 48 hours and half of today was just dry heaving. I ended up having a shower to try and relieve some of the pain and ended up dry heaving more to the point my throat was burning and my head was throbbing. I ended up calling my mum to ask for help getting to the hospital and once there I was seen and put into a ward within the first 15 minutes of arriving (this is absolutely wonderful considering I\u2019ve spent 6 hours in the waiting room alone). They took my bloods, urine test, etc. the normal stuff. And eventually put me on an IV drip cause I was too dehydrated. Today\u2019s visit is so different from any others because the doctor who saw me (his name tag said his name was Ian) talked to me like I was an actual patient, like I was a sane human being who was actually in pain and unwell and believed me. He talked to me about his knowledge of endometriosis, my history with it and gave me advice on the best ways to be taking my medications. He also said it won\u2019t necessarily be a miracle worker doing it this way or the way I was doing it before but it is worth a try. He knows it a chronic illness, he knows it\u2019s incurable and he wasn\u2019t trying to tell me that things will get better if I do a, b and c. Most doctors talk to me like I\u2019m crazy and it\u2019s all in my head that I leave the hospital in the same amount of pain if not more and extremely frustrated and angry because of the lack of knowledge or understanding or acceptance that DOCTORS have on this. But instead of being talked DOWN to he talked to me. He asked what I was feeling and what I wanted out of this. Apart from my GP he has been the best doctor I have seen. My pain went from a 12 out of 10 to an 8 out of 10 (which I know is still pretty high on the scale but on a day to day that is normal or average for me), it when down 4 units on the scales cause he took me seriously and listened to me and actually helped me. Instead of giving me pain killers I\u2019ve already taken that weren\u2019t working, hence going into hospital for additional help, he gave me oxycodone which is a strong pain killer I\u2019ve never had before and it brought my pain down.

{"id": "endometriosis_jkhcsb", "text": "Ok I'm really hoping this sub can help me out.\n\nAbout 6 years ago (when I was 26), out of nowhere, I started having terrible pain during sex. I was with my partner for two years before this point and nothing had changed in our sex life or personal life. It got to the point that I started to fear penetration because the pain would have me doubled over for 30-45 minutes. It felt like my ovaries were exploding while at the same time feeling incredibly constipated. We eventually broke up (for unrelated reasons) and a year later I started dating someone else. We were together for about a year when the pain started again. This time though, I started showing other symptoms (irregular and painful periods, exhaustion, etc) and a friend of mine suggested it might be endometriosis. I've been going to the same OBGYN for three years now on a recommendation by another woman with endometriosis but honestly, it's been a nightmare. For starters, other than that one time (which lasted about 6 months) I haven't experienced any really terrible endometriosis symptoms. The only thing that keeps consistently coming up is unexpected pain during sex but the thing is... it only happens after I've been with a partner for a while. \n\nMy doctor(s) has no answer for me. It doesn't help that over the course of these three years, I've seen 4 practitioners (the first one was amazing but got pregnant and left her job) and they all start the process of evaluating me all over again. I don't want birth control because I've tried them all and they don't work well with me and my hormones but since BC is off the table they've basically refused to really do anything for me and have dragged their feet (FOR TWO YEARS) when I've asked about surgery. The last one told me to just try different positions and talk to my partner about our relationship. I know the difference between pain from lack of interest/being unsatisfied and this.

{"id": "endometriosis_k33iug", "text": "Last night I (19F) was awake up till 3am with this weird abdomen pain. To be completely honest, I thought it was just because I was badly bloated. I was able to just fall asleep, it wasn't incredibly painful and I thought I've had worse. I then woke up around 5-5:30am with the same pain just ten times worse. I had to call my dad, whose a dermatologist and was a GP for a few years, to get my codeine paracetamol (its like a combination of the two painkillers) because I couldn't move. Usually I would have one of these and one paracetamol tablet but he decided to give me two. They kicked in around 6:30am and for an hour I was just talking to a friend. I was able to get up and get me some water but I had to walk with a limp and crouched over. Suddenly, at 7:30am, the pain just became so much worse. The pain made me feel so ill I threw up. I have a high tolerance when it comes to nausea, I use to throw up from my period a lot so I became better at resisting it but I couldn't today, the pain was just that bad. I hadn't eaten anything so it was that type of vomit. I found it difficult to walk back to my room, and the bathroom is really close to my room. I tried to just go to sleep but it was too painful so I called my dad again. He checked to see if it was my appendix. No, it was just exactly where my ultrasound noted where my endometriosis would be on my right abdomen, and the left lower abdomen where I've been getting this weird pain above my ovary, and my breasts hurt so much. That's how I could tell it was my endometriosis. When the pain woke me up at 6am I just went oh god it's my endo. Like my dad may be a doctor, but I just know my body. I know what pains means it's your period. I kept telling him it's my endometriosis it's not my appendix. I'm not even on my period, I start the sugar pill today. My dad gave me a hot water bottle but in order for it to work it had to have boiling water in it. I was able to take another tablet of paracetamol codeine at 9am and it quickly begun to work within the next 15 minutes. Thank god it did work because my dad said he would've taken me to the hospital if it didn't and I just didn't want to go to the hospital in that state. \n\nI fell asleep and woke up around 10:30am. It was just aching. All the muscles of my abdomen and all that private area. I sat on the toilet and the muscles ached when I urinated. It hurts to sit down. I have to sit down like an old woman who has arthritis. It's just this numb aching feeling, and it's the afternoon now. I had the hiccups when I woke up at 10am and it really just hurt. I was so tired by just vacuuming for fives minutes and folding a little bit of laundry, that I fell asleep around 11:30am. It was such a nice day, I was going to ask my sister if she wanted to go shopping with me. I wasted this day. No, my endometriosis made me waste this day. But my dog laid with me, cuddled with me when I woke up around lunchtime. She's a bit of a mop head right now because we couldn't get her in for a cut till next week. She's a cavoodle, she's very smart when noticing when I'm in pain. It made me feel better just knowing she was aware I wasn't 100%.\n\nI am proud to state I didn't cry because of the pain, no matter how much it throbbed, cramped my back, or the burning feeling in my abdomen, I didn't give in. I only started crying because I was just so tired and frustrated with my endo. I'm a little sleep deprived, I had exams and only had about three hours of sleep. I don't have any contact with my mum and even though my dad is a doctor, it's not his area of expertise and he hasn't been a GP in like thirty years, but no matter how many times I called him, he explained to me what was happening, ensured when I got up I was somewhat productive, made sure I had lunch, it made me feel better. I felt so alone when the pain first begun. I didn't have an older woman to help me, and I'm only young. It's as my grandma says, women can feel the pain of others better than men. Though, some good news, my sister, who isn't very supportive, saw how much pain I can be in, and I think she's beginning to realise how painful endometriosis is.

This is my first post so I'll try to keep it as detailed and concise as possible:\nI'm currently 20 years old and I just went to an OB/GYN in South Korea to detect signs of endo at a fraction of the healthcare costs in the states :,) this was my first time getting checked up and I explained all my symptoms, such as:\n- constantly feeling gassy and bloated\n- \"butt lighting\" during period (it felt like I was actually going to die on the toilet-- it was absolutely terrifying, and this recently happened which led to fearful research haha)\n- mild period cramps-- I have a regular cycle and a slightly heavy flow but nothing \"abnormal\". This is why i initially dismissed my symtomps\n- started to have severe lower back pain ever since my period got regular in middle school (I went to a chiropractor and got physical therapy bc apparently I have \"very stiff back muscles\" and not enough of a healthy curvature in my back, but still don't know if this explains the rest of my symptoms)\n- frequent headaches\n- frequent brain fog, forgetfulness, feelings of depression, mood swings\n\nHowever, after the tests came back clean, the doctor told me I should just stretch to relieve my back pain and that the pain when I poop on my period can just happen for no reason and that it's normal. I was honestly pretty discouraged because I wanted a clearer answer to why my periods suck beyond just needing a chiropractor :/ I'm considering finding an endo specialist in the states but I'm not sure if going through a lap will be worth it for a diagnosis, considering the hefty prices (I do have insurance but idk how much is covered). My parents are both very skeptical and have completely passed the need for further testing because that doctor claimed my symptoms to be \"normal\".

{"id": "endometriosis_h0mmgp", "text": "I had an appointment with a new GYN last week (who I had met only once before at a previous Appt), because I\u2019ve been in constant pain for weeks after a month-long period. I finally laid it out bluntly that I want a laparoscopy because I can\u2019t deal with this pain anymore and I don\u2019t want to be taking painkillers everyday for an unforetold amount of time. I told him I knew it wasn\u2019t a permanent fix, but none of my previous doctors wanted to do a lap on me and I\u2019m at the end of my rope. I was prescribed Orilissa by my other doctor, but he keeps taking me off of it because he is afraid of me developing osteoporosis (which is an apparent side effect of the pills) even though it works well for me. Now I\u2019m on a new insurance and they refuse to cover it. But finally, I got the words I\u2019ve wanted to hear from a doctor in over a decade: \u201cLet\u2019s schedule you for a Lap.\u201d He seemed kinda unsure about it as if I\u2019m a crazy person who just really wants to have surgery for no reason (which is how I\u2019ve felt for years when I\u2019ve asked for a lap before). However, he said he\u2019ll do it, and that\u2019s all I really want. I don\u2019t really care what he thinks, I just want the damn lap and an official diagnosis. \n\nFast forward to a week later (today). I have not gotten the call about scheduling a pre-op like he said I would. I kinda reached my breaking point today and cried to my mother who also has it. She encouraged me to call them and ask to go ahead and schedule the pre-op, and that I shouldn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being pushy to at least ask. So I did call, and apparently he never even put it through. Even though I begged him and told him literally that I\u2019m at the end of my rope and that I can\u2019t do this anymore. He just didn\u2019t put it through. She said she\u2019d \u201cput it on his desk, \u201c but that doesn\u2019t make me feel any better. I won\u2019t feel better until I\u2019m literally in surgery and it\u2019s actually happening. I\u2019ve felt defeated and as if no one will ever truly believe me before, but it\u2019s really hitting me now. I\u2019m in bed with a heating pad crying my eyes out and thinking maybe I really am crazy and it\u2019s not as bad as I think. But then I feel the cramps and know that I can\u2019t be crazy when I truly am in this much pain. \n\nEven in the Appt with him last week, he seemed unsure about doing it and made sure to add an extra slap across my face by saying how exercise can help cramps. Well, how the hell am I supposed to exercise when I can\u2019t even walk across a room without doubling over?? I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore, and I\u2019m terrified about how I\u2019ll feel when I run out of the non-refillable prescription of hydrocodone he gave me back in May. I try everyday to not take it when I get up and see how I feel, but everyday I end up taking it because the pain is intolerable. \n\nI know this is long, but I just feel so hopeless. I\u2019m 26 and have been dealing with this since I was like 11. This pain has been going on for weeks, and I can\u2019t do anything physical that I love to do like rollerblading or walking the dog and I feel useless and like I\u2019m a crazy person that everyone is dismissing. I feel dismissed by everyone- the doctor, the lady I spoke to on the phone today, all the other doctors I\u2019ve ever had since I was 11. Everyone is making me feel like I\u2019m just making this up and it\u2019s not that bad and some days I wonder if I really am just being over dramatic. Does anyone else feel like this? Does it ever get better? Will anyone ever take it seriously? \n\nUgh sorry I know this is crazy long but I really needed to rant and get feedback from other people who can understand.

That worked wonders but didn't take away the pain. Then he retired. I have spent the last six years hopping from one OBGYN to another. I have been referred for anxiety (currently on meds), gastrointestinal crap (have had colonoscopy and endoscopy, both clean), have been put on diets, told I need to lose weight. And nobody will listen to me that I'm able to track my symptoms by my cycle because I no longer get a period.\n\nIn the last six years, I've ended up in the ER seven times in six years for pain that mimics appendicitis but turns out to be burst cysts that they INSIST are luteal.\n\nHowever, the last ER trip (courtesy of an ambulance), they finally saw the convulsions from pain and decided that after six doses of Dilaudid that there really was something going on. They brought an actual OB down to the ER. She listened to me and gave me a referral. This is the first time since the doc who did the ablation that they actually listened and I got the referral I needed.\n\nSo tomorrow morning, 8:45, I meet the doc that specializes in this and won't write it off as anxiety or constipation.\n\nPlease keep your fingers crossed for me. I'm sick of docs not believing this is real. And I'm terrified that even with my literal years of documentation, the fact that we have ruled out everything under the sun, that she won't do what I want. I want her to take out my uterus and right ovary, and then use her magic to remove whatever scar tissue she sees. I know it's there because the doc who did my second C-section literally said \"wow you've got a lot of scar tissue in here. Has anyone ever mentioned fibroids or endometriosis?\" But then he handed me my beautiful screaming kid and I did exactly remember to follow up right away.\n\nPlease think good thoughts for me. I'm tired of losing  weeks out of every year to pain that nobody thinks is real.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/iwr0mw/tomorrow_is_the_day_of_reckoning/"}

After many drug trials we did another lap which helped for about 3 years this time and that brings us to where we are now.\n\nSo I\u2019m now 28 and married and we are ready to ttc. Unfortunately literally the day after my wedding the endo decided it is now time to rise and cue the severe pain blah blah you guys know how terrible endo is. \n\nSo after constant pain even on hormonal birth control, doctor suggests a 3 month Lupron course as a way to clear out some of the endo and help with pain relief. He says especially since my endo has spread to my bladder and spine, let\u2019s try this before surgery since endo removal on non/reproductive organs isn\u2019t something his surgeon will do anyway. I\u2019m in pain and have been fighting trying Lupron for awhile anyway so figure I\u2019ll give it a shot. \n\nOh boy. First couple weeks was insane cramps and period. Like the period from hell basically. Then that faded and the cramps did fade with it! But then I was left with constant stomach upset, gas, nausea to the point I only eat one meal a day, MOOD SWINGS OMG, hot flashes, and extreme fatigue and dizziness. \n\nAnd now, only 6 weeks into the 3 month shot, I am starting to feel my endo twinge again. The pulling and the sudden stabbing pains if you move too much or heaven forbid THE WRONG WAY. Really?!?! I\u2019m going through all these nasty side effects and the endo doesn\u2019t have the nerve to stay dormant for at least 3 month?! Just rude. \n\nAnd to top it off, I\u2019d been trying to go to work and had been making it in for half the day, but work has now told me I should just go on disability (salaried employee so it makes more sense). Which honestly I\u2019d been thinking about but it just feels like letting the Lupron win. And honestly I did not expect Lupron to make me completely unable to live my life so this is all just a bit of a shock. But then I\u2019m home on the couch and smoking a ton of weed for the pain and I think to myself, I feel fine, I could go to work! And then I have endless guilt about not going to work, about causing my husband all this worry, about the fact that my body is broken, the usual downward spiral we all feel sometimes. \n\nLife just sucks right now and I\u2019m holding onto hope the terrible Lupron will help me get pregnant in the long run but it sucks right now. And I\u2019m constantly crying over the fact that my 2 year old cat is going to die one day, so hormones are really fun on Lupron too *cry-laugh*\n\nJust trying to make it through until my next doctor appointment in 2 weeks, I\u2019m just asking for the surgery. Unfortunately I live in a location that doesn\u2019t have any excision specialists so I\u2019ve had ablation surgeries, but they are definitely effective for me anyway at keeping the endo at bay and way better than the drug treatments. \n\nEven if they can get rid of some of the endo on my reproductive organs that\u2019s better than this. And the hope is I can get pregnant after surgery and BAM endo is like pregnancy? how scary and goes away (and they all lived happily ever after LOL)\n\nTLDR: my body doesn\u2019t like Lupron so I have to go on disability and I\u2019m frustrated and very upset about it but also trying to keep a positive outlook - this is all so that we can hopefully have a wonderful little baby!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/ifqzhp/life_on_lupron/"}

The line got darker over the next few days, but still fairly faint but clear enough to see. I ended up taking a blood test a week after and it negative, with HCG levels less than 2.

{"id": "endometriosis_ew56ez", "text": "LONG POST AHEAD (warning for depictions of personal symptoms and potentially gross stuff):\n\nSo the jist is that I've been dealing with progressively worsening issues for the past 2-3 years and have never found a resolution or diagnosis. I feel unsure I'm taking the right path by pursuing something that's less painful than it is irritating. I don't experience severe pain on a regular basis, I don't have a super heavy period and I don't get bad pain before and after a period.\n\nI have discussed and compared symptoms with people I know who have endo and most report getting pretty severe pain on the regular along with other problems I don't really get, which is making me doubt whether I should try persue this considering there are people with other severe symptoms who may need it much more urgently than I, and it's between a 3-4 month wait to see a specialist.\n\nFor example:\n\n\u2022 I get bad period pain that only really starts as soon as I get my period (might have a slight ache on and off for a day or 2 beforehand but that's it). Occasionally it's bad enough that if I get it while I'm sleeping I will wake up immediately and need ibuprofen, paracetamol, a heat bag + an hour of time before it settles to a bearable level.\n\n\u2022 I rarely get extended severe pain outside of a period, maybe 1-2 times a month, but when I do it's sharp, sore to press on and can feel like something inside me is pulling in the pelvic region (can last between 1-2 days). When I have this pain, going to the toilet, walking, sneezing etc can all make this pain acutely worse.\n\n\u2022 Sometimes I get a quick, sharp stabby pain near my cervix/bowel that lasts 5-10 seconds and then it goes.\n\n\u2022 I have sciatica in my lower back/hip but I am never sure if this is related or just a separate issue entirely (I have been seeing a physio for 1+ years and it's never been resolved, only treated to reduce pain flares).\n\n\u2022 I have difficulties going to the toilet and feel like I need to defecate all the time/feel full constantly. (I have had a colonoscopy and results showed nothing. Have been diagnosed with IBS, but this issue is continuously getting worse to the point I'm getting depressed about it and it's genuinely ruining my life. I'm chronically on fibre supplements but they only help a little).\n\n\u2022 While on my period I have had blood come out while defecating. I noticed this 6 months ago but thought it was just period blood from my vagina and thought nothing of it. I will need to wait until my next period to confirm this 100%.\n\n\u2022 Small bumps on surface of Cervix. Not painful, but feel larger during period?\n\n\u2022 Sometimes I get an ache in my pelvic region, like a 2 on the pain scale, but usually that's it. Not consistent, like 15 mins of a slight ache, and gentle enough that I can ignore it easily.\n\n\u2022 Bad bloating on period during first 2-3 days (Is this normal?)\n\nI had a colonoscopy about a year and a half ago that showed nothing unusual and was diagnosed with IBS instead. About 3 months ago I had an external pelvic ultrasound that, again, showed nothing.\n\nI've booked an appt with a gyno specialist via Dr referral, but I'm afraid of pursuing it, getting laparoscopy, then coming out with no diagnosis, having wasted people's time and even more frustrated.

She told me to go to my regular GYN first and try different birth control because \"we don't want to mess around in there at this age (23) because I might want kids\"  I am so beyond disappointed. What she told me could not be further from the truth. Why do doctors spew this bs? If you don't know refer your patients to someone who does. Luckily I am well researched and know better but how many patients get this advice and follow it?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/ht6ooo/disappointed_by_my_doctor_vent/"}

What else can you do to manage the symptoms and the episodes?\n\nI was her foster parent for a couple of years and she is like family to me.

Everything seemed peachy but now im unsure. I have the sensation that my guts are going to fall out everytime i urinate or have a bowel movement. Im cramping very similarly to how i would cramp prior to my procedure (ie: shooting pain down the legs, contraction like squeezing on the uterus, stabbing pains where i imagine my ovaries to be, back pain around the kidney area). My whole right side is also still very sore. Getting up from sitting, laying on that side, laughing, coughing are all are very painful still. My gynos assistant had talked to me yesterday and told me to call tomorrow if i still had the pain while urinating. Im just wondering if this has happened to others? Maybe my body is just taking longer to heal? Im unsure at this point. I still plan to call tomorrow as the glue came off one of my incisions and is now open and exposed.

Putting it out there I\u2019m Male. \n\nMy partner was diagnosed some years ago now, maybe as many as 7 years ago. It has impacted our lives in many ways. Low energy, depression, but also dyspareunia. \n\nThe other stuff we have found workarounds for or resolutions to. Going to bed at 7:30 is a normal bedtime, for example. \n\nBut the pain during sex has caused our sex life to drop to basically two or three times a year and honestly that\u2019s generally when I have complained about not having had sex for 4 months or something. \n\nI don\u2019t want to sit and complain about my sex life. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m here. \n\nWhy I\u2019m here is to ask if anyone here has experienced this substantial drop in sex drive, and the anxiety that seems to come with it (ie where you\u2019re thinking oh I should have sex but it will hurt etc which then causes you to be tense when you do have it, which makes it hurt more... and on and on), and whether anyone has found any working resolutions to the problem?\n\nI mean for me intercourse itself isn\u2019t a MUST. There are other things that you can do. No need for details there, you get the picture. But it has got to a point beyond that for us now where my partner just cringes at the idea of any kind of intimacy whatsoever. \n\nI want to make her feel comfortable and relaxed in her own skin, and I want, and I\u2019ll just be really honest here, to have sex more than once every 4 months. Not every day (ok. I do want it every day lol) but realistically let\u2019s say once a month. \n\nIt\u2019s so hard to type this message without coming across like a guy wanting to \u201cget some\u201d.

{"id": "endometriosis_k0n7xk", "text": "Hi all! New here. I\u2019ve suspected I had endo for several years now but only recently learned of a possible link between endo and kidney issues I\u2019ve had for years. I\u2019m wanting to find more info about this kind or similar of endo, or connect with anyone who has had a similar experience. I already know this will be lengthy but pleeeaase share any and all knowledge, I\u2019m desperate.\n\nWhen I was 17 I started having these episodes of debilitating pain in what I thought was my right kidney. It would happen every few weeks or months, and then a cluster of a bunch of episodes in a row, then nothing again for a while. Every time the episodes are the same: I feel like I have to pee, and before I even get to the bathroom, the act of holding my pee suddenly causes this ridiculous sharp pain that clenches my kidneys. Some episodes are worse than others, but oftentimes the pain is so severe that I collapse and can only lay facedown on the ground until it goes away. It feels like my kidney is about to explode out of my back. At the worst and most recent episode, in August, I went from being perfectly fine to laying on the ground drenched in sweat and hunched over a trash bag because I was about to throw up in 60 seconds flat. That one was the worst pain I\u2019ve ever felt and I know if I have an episode any worse, I will black out. A few minutes later the pain subsides and then is just tender, like the way my back might be sore if I got kicked there. Taking pain meds obviously doesn\u2019t help because they don\u2019t kick in until the episode is already going away.\n\nSo that\u2019s been going on for about 10 years. It used to happen more often than it does now, but the episodes are perhaps more severe and I worry they\u2019re causing permanent damage to my kidneys or ureters. I also worry that an episode will happen when I\u2019m in public, which I\u2019ve lucked out on so far. They\u2019re almost always the right kidney. I also have had probably at least a dozen UTIs and some severe kidney infections.\n\nI\u2019ve seen NUMEROUS doctors about these episodes. At least two OBGYNs, at least 3-4 primary care doctors, every single urgent care staff member for every UTI I\u2019ve had... I\u2019ve been asked by a male doctor if I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not period pain. (....I\u2019m sure.) I\u2019ve had an ultrasound done that showed nothing (no kidney stones). I\u2019ve had them say I just have a UTI. I\u2019ve had OBGYNs say let\u2019s try birth control it fixes everything. (It didn\u2019t.) I\u2019ve researched symptom keyword I can think of with absolutely no diagnoses that sound like what I deal with.\n\nAfter the episode in August, the worst one ever, I was so fed up with I set up an appointment with a urologist myself. I couldn\u2019t get in for two months, and of course I was feeling fine for the appointment, but he was SO kind and helpful. He thought it may be a ureteral obstruction, something periodically blocking the tube between my kidney and bladder. He ordered a CAT scan but warned me that since I wasn\u2019t having an episode now, it was possible nothing would show up. And nothing did. What I\u2019m supposed to do now is wait for another episode to happen, whenever that may be, and immediately get to the ER to get another cat scan under his orders.\n\nI\u2019m fairly certain his diagnosis is correct even if it hasn\u2019t been shown yet, but the issue is what is causing the obstruction. This would explain the correlation to having to pee, and a blockage causing urine to backflow into the kidney would explain the repeated kidney infections. I have only just learned that endometriosis can cause ureteral obstructions, and a lot of times quite severe leading to permanent renal damage.\n\nI\u2019ve ALSO had unpredictable female issues since I was about 19, which I have long suspected is endo, and it did not occur to me that these things might be related. (they never occurred at any specific time of the month) I started having periods every other week. Bad pain the day before period and first day or two of, but frankly it\u2019s nothing compared to the episodes. I started on pills and my period got better for a bit, but kidney/ureteral episodes still were as normal. Every time I\u2019ve been on a pill for about a year, it just stops working. My body goes crazy and starts having periods every other week regardless of where I\u2019m at in the pill pack. I also suspect I fertility is not easy for me. I\u2019m on my 5th or 6th different type of birth control pills.\n\nA few months ago I also started having some pain in what feels like my right ovary. I told my OBGYN about this at the last visit and she found it odd but knew I was also seeing a urologist for kidney issues, and said that if fixing the kidney issues didn\u2019t also fix the ovarian pain we\u2019d look into it further. The ovarian pain has come back with increasing frequency since and I\u2019ve been feeling it nonstop for two days straight. This pain is different than the episodes in that it\u2019s more minor and is constant. It\u2019s in the front (feels like it\u2019s inside my right hip/pelvis) while episode pain is specifically in my back, a little higher up. However, they are on the same side.\n\nI know it\u2019s SO hard to get endo diagnosed and I\u2019ve brought it up to OBGYNs before but have really just been told that pills will help without anyone looking further into things. And like I said, I\u2019m worried about permanent damage, which seems a real concern with ureteral endo.\n\nSo... what do I do from here? Please tell me any urinary symptoms you\u2019ve had. Episodes of pain not correlating with periods? Ureteral obstructions with endo? Pain specifically on right side? Nothing visible on ultrasound or cat scan? I don\u2019t know what to push for and feel helpless until another episode happens. I don\u2019t even know if my urologist would be helpful if it IS endo. This has been so hard to research but I do NOT want another episode like August and am fighting for answers here.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/k0n7xk/endo_with_ureteral_involvementureteral_obstruction/"}

She said my case is so complicated and probably beyond her expertise so she referred me to a pelvic surgeon in the practice who is apparently quite renown and women regularly travel a long way to have him perform surgery. He uses a DaVinci robot which I've heard of but have never experienced. Ok, cool. I see him in 3 weeks. \n\nMy doctor and I discussed options.

I have diagnosed endometriosis, adenomyosis, depression and suspected cfs.\n\nAs medicines I take Deso (estrogen +progesterone pills), an antidepressant called Deanxit and Pantoprazol to protect the stomach.\n...\n\nI live in daily pain due to my conditions. Normally it is moderate 5 to 7/10 (average of 6.5) with ocasional days of intense pain 8/10 and very rare days of excruciating pain 9+/10.\n\nIbuprofen used to help me manage my pain when it was not daily. I would take it as soon as I felt some pain and it would (sometimes) stop it from growing into a bigger pain. However now that I have pain daily it does not seem to help, no matter the dosis.\n\nParacetamol does not seem to do any effect. I was given Diclofenac to take daily by my ginecologist, but as paracetamol, it doesnt seem to affect my pain so I am not taking it anymore.\n\nHe also gave me a presciption for Tramadol for the very intense pain. This seems to work, but it takes a few hours to make effect, obviously I cant take it daily (I only have a box that I treasure more than gold) and it gives me nightmares.\n\nI also tried Naproxen, prescribed by my neurologist. It seems to work for moderate pain (5-7/10) but I was told that I cant take it daily, so its not that useful.\n\n...\n\nI am looking for recommendations for some painkillers that I could take daily (like I was supposed to take the diclofenac) to manage my daily moderate pain. \n\nI wont be able to get it here without a prescription, but I want some advice to have more knowledge about the topic when corona passes and I am allowed to go back to seek treatment for my diseases.\n\nI am asking advice online because my gynecologist apointments were cancelled and the pain is driving me crazy. I wont be able to ask for advice until the corona situation stabilizes.\n\nAny advice?\nThanks!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/g944r2/painkillers_for_daily_moderate_pain/"}

{"id": "endometriosis_jur7v5", "text": "Hi guys, new to this sub so apologies if this kinda stuff has been asked a lot. I'm just *so* desperate for some help!!\n\nI've been wondering if I have endo for some time now, but never got a conclusive answer from GP or anything helpful tbh. Wanted to share my symptoms etc to see if anyone can help and if I should go to the GP again and push for a lap, as things have been getting worse recently. I'll try and keep it short! Any advice would be absolutely amazing! I'm 19 btw.\n\nGot my period when I was 12. Pretty normal periods, prob slightly on the heavier side and averagely painful I would say. Then things wen't downhill...\n\nWhen I was 16 I got my period for that month and had the most horrendous cramps, like nothing I'd ever had before. I remember just being curled up in a ball on the floor crying because I couldn't even think about moving. I had quite bad diarrhea too - \"period shits\" that I would sometimes get on my period, but worse than before.\n\nFrom then onwards most periods were very painful and pretty heavy, lasting about 6 or 7 days. They kept increasing in pain until one morning about a year and a half after the first bad one I woke up with the awful cramps, had to rush to the loo urgently to shit and passed out on the loo, a sweaty mess - classy!\n\nThen I went to the doctor and they basically just prescribed me the (combined) pill, said it would help the pain. Pretty sure I mentioned endo but I know BC is a first option for period pain to mask symptoms of endo, so I guess that's why they prescribed it.\n\nSo I went on the pill and my cramps COMPLETELY stopped. It was amazing!\n\nThen about six months later I started having awful stomach issues, urgent diarrhea, cramps, bloating, nausea - the whole shebang. Was diagnosed with IBS. The possibility of Endo still stayed in my mind, and I did some research and found out that endo if often misdiagnosed as IBS. So I went to see a doctor to ask about it, and basically they told me that I could have it but there's not much they can do until I want to get pregnant and start having fertility issues! They gave me an ultrasound (which can't even detect endo??) which didn't find any cysts, but the transvaginal one didn't work because it was too painful when inserted - which isn't that another symptom of endo??!\n\nAfter I'd been on the pill for about a year, the cramps started coming back. Not nearly as bad as they used to be, but still they're slowly getting worse I think. And also in this last year my IBS has just been awful. It's okay for a bit but the flair ups are just getting worse and worse. However, they don't seem to be *particularly* worse around my period, which it usually is with endo (??). However, as I said the cramps are coming back and I'm on my period right now and it's just been awful - horrendous diarrhea 5-7 times a day and awful cramps. Hence why I'm started to consider endo again.\n\nDo you think I have it? I'm hesitant to contact GP again as they're pretty unhelpful and seem to not really be able to do anything. Also I'm worried they'll just change me to another pill, which fair enough if it stops endo growth but with the symptoms returning... the IBS is getting unbearable and cramps returning is not a good sign...\n\nALSO, the cramps I get for IBS are pretty much exactly where you get period cramps. I get them very suddenly when I have to shit and during shitting too. They go when I've finished (period ones don't always).\n\nOr do you think it's just IBS? I do defo have very somatic anxiety and stress for sure fucks up my GI, but the urgent diarrhea often comes completely out of the blue when I'm not even anxious or stressed, which didn't happen so much when I was younger.\n\nI'm not sure if my pain is severe enough to be endo - I mean it's horrendous but some people describe having like 4 Imodium and still not being able to walk - I wouldn't say it's that bad. Paracetamol and hot water bottle will help for me but you can still feel it there.\n\nIf I'm on the pill, isn't that meant to stop the growth? So why are symptoms returning?\n\nSorry for the massive rant but any advice would be absolutely amazing!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/jur7v5/please_help_awful_ibs_periods_worsening_again/"}

I had lesions on my bowel, uterus, fallopian tubes, etc. When I went to the ER before I was diagnosed, they did a CT and found a hepatic adenoma on my liver as an incidental finding. I get repeat scans every six months and the tumor is stable but there\u2019s still the risk of it spontaneously rupturing but more importantly, I\u2019m not allowed to take any birth control with estrogen in it anymore because it can cause the tumor to grow. It\u2019s also not recommended that I get pregnant. \n\nI\u2019ve consulted with gyn and GI independently but have thus far been unable to get them to coordinate my care. I would like the tumor removed because I felt like my pain was most adequately managed with Xulane, the patch. Now I\u2019m on Norethindrone and while the pain is not 100% debilitating, it\u2019s FAR worse than it was before. I\u2019ve tried and failed Danazol, Synarel, and Orlissa and I refuse to do Lupron because if I fail that, I can\u2019t just stop taking the medication. \n\nMy first lap, they did ablation and my pain never went away.

I got a mirena and it was fine for a bit, and then started ramping up with cramps, and with pelvic pain/bleeding after sex. I had it removed and went on a pill for several years, had less issues but occasional crappy cramps. \n\nI went off that pill to get pregnant, had my son, had a skyla IUD put in at 7 weeks postpartum. That went fine, I had it removed when it expired and then tried (the same) pills again, got suicidal. Got another skyla in because it worked last time. Now I've been having issues with cramping/bleeding after sex for the year since I got it put in, two totally clear transvaginal ultrasounds that showed it in the right place (October last year, and again last week). \n\nI have also been having left ovary pain that my doctors and I have been chalking up to ovarian cysts, once every year or so since I was 15. Sometimes I get a few more per year that are annoying, but not bad enough to need pain meds. I have now had 2 in the last 3 months that were bad enough to need pain meds. I am still experiencing pelvic pain from the last one, which was last weekend, and caused bleeding for a couple hours. And every time I attempt sex or have an orgasm since then it gets worse. The GYN I saw last week after my ultrasound said the IUD is in position perfectly, but could be contributing to chat formation and maybe we should take it out. Suggested a nexplanon to replace it. Also mentioned it could be endometriosis but it would be \"uncharacteristic\" for endometriosis to only cause issues sporadically instead of constantly. I liked her, it was the first time I ever saw her, and she definitely respected my knowledge of my own body and the research I did before I came in. \n\nTbh, I've had some gyn issues on and off since puberty with regard to the cysts and cramping and painful sex and postcoital bleeding and pain. I just have been busy dealing with the fact that I have a connective tissue disorder and comorbid issues for the past 12 years and have kind of just shrugged my gyn issues off with \"eh, my body is garbage, it's whatever.\" But it starts getting really bad with the cramping and pain whenever I'm having a really active sex life that I enjoy and I'm super fucking over it right now. I also have a tendency towards fatigue and bloating and baseline constipation that I've all kind of assumed were related to the connective tissue stuff.

I\u2019ve had crazy pain in my right side/down my hip/legs ever since this started and the Visanne helped for a bit but now it\u2019s bad again so I went back to see my specialist today. After a lengthy discussion (he is amazing), he is also putting me on Cymbalta as a measure of pain and anxiety relief. \n\nHas anyone taken both? What have been your experiences? \n\nThanks so much!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/ezwxoy/visanne_and_cymbalta/"}

My dr, who is meant to be head of his field here and has glowing reviews on Nancys Nook, told me that 'properly done ablation is just as effective' but somehow I doubt this is true.

My symptoms are drastically worse since that lap than they were before it.\n\nI know there's no way to know, except surgery.\n\nProblem is, I had a really awful experience with my first lap (just prior to the successful one). I nearly died on the operating table through acts of medical negligence that I won't go into, but it has caused a LOT of anxiety and fear of it happening again.

Why can't they just give me something stronger post-op? They're also not taking my bleeding disorder seriously. I've told them twice that I'll need a platelet infusion prior to surgery. They just tell me it'll be fine and they'll check my platelets before the surgery...except that's not how it works. I have plenty of platelets, they just don't function well enough to clot properly. Also because of the bleeding disorder, I can't take any NSAIDS which is a huge part of pain management post-op, so I'm fucked there. They've already put a 2 week limit on the narcotic use post-op. I feel like I'm being treated like a child, addict and/or crazy person! I feel like I'm on the verge of sobbing and having a panic attack. What do I do?

I want to start by saying that I\u2019m working with a great therapist, and I am able to feel happy and hopeful most days.\n\nBut today is rough. \n\nI first started experiencing endo pain at 9. I\u2019m 25. That\u2019s 16 years. I have done truly everything that is supposed to manage endo/ treat endo and I\u2019ve always had pretty blah results. Physical therapy works well for me, but I have to go pretty constantly, which is expensive and impractical at times. Especially with covid. I\u2019ve accepted that until I can afford excision, and find a surgeon that I trust, that my plan is continuous birth control and physical therapy as needed. That\u2019s ok, truly. It works for me. \n\nHowever, it seems that every pill works for a while and then I find myself in the thick of the side effects. I am simply the type of person who is more prone to the weird side effects from birth control. The new pill I\u2019m on is working for me. I don\u2019t love it, but it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been on birth control without horrifying anxiety, and it does its job better than any of my past pills. I get really bad migraines and nausea, so my doctor had me cut my dosage in half, and it\u2019s a little better. She warned me, though, that hair loss is a side effect, but it\u2019s rare. \n\nWell, today, like many other days over the past few months, I was left with a palm full of hair after I washed and combed my hair. I\u2019m constantly cleaning hair out of the sink, and pulling it from between my fingers. And now, I can see my scalp a bit when I pull it into a ponytail, or when I want to clip it up with some cute Barrettes. I\u2019m usually able to breathe through it, remind myself that it\u2019s just hair, and that I\u2019ve survived a lot worse than thin locks. But today y\u2019all...today that is simply impossible. I\u2019m sad about it. I\u2019m giving myself the day to wallow in it. I feel like we have to accept so many things and grieve so many losses with endo. I\u2019ve lost pregnancies, friendships, my social life, My sex life, my appetite/ love of food, my career, etc. we have to lose so much. And today, I can\u2019t put my hair loss into the big picture. Today I\u2019m just pissed that on top of everything else, I have to lose the long locks that have always been my defining feature. \n\nI\u2019ll be having my thyroid check, and I have an appointment to cut my hair shorter in order to take some of the strain off of the ladies that are holding on. And I know I\u2019ll be fine. Hair loss is temporary. I\u2019ve already scaled back my medicine, which should help. I\u2019ve added supplements and top of the line hair care products.

My main ones are nausea and mood changes. I've lost touch with my communication skills, I've been hypersensitive to insults and anything negative targeted towards me. So I've been super defensive...

I just want to stop the medicine, but I know I can't right now. I know I need to grit through just a little longer because it hasn't been long enough. But I absolutely hate it.

At the time I had an IUD (2nd one, 8years), and decided to have it removed to see if it would offer any relief.   I had also been dealing with back pain, migraines, skin issues, chest pain, nausea. Some of that for many years. \n\nOnce I had the IUD removed, it seemed like some of the issues eased up a bit, but then I started the pill and new symptoms started and old ones worsened.

From my right shoulder blade down to my elbow, and onto my fingers. I can\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m always uncomfortable.

I finally found a new doctor and I lay out my symptoms from almost every week for every cycle for the last year, she does a quick physical exam, tells me she can feel thickened ligaments that are in line with endometriosis.\n\nShe explains medication type treatment options to stop the ovaries from working or using birth control but we are planning to have children in the bea future so neither of these are viable options. She started explaining that even pregnancy would be a possible treatment option but that the symptoms would only subside during and shortly afterwards and the then suggests a laparoscopy and my heart sank a little listening to her explain the process.\n\nShe said she would put a couple of holes in my belly, gas in my abdomen so she can look around, and then she would burn off what she could find minus anything attached to my bladder or rectum because of the risk of damage. First off, I'm terrified of the holes in my belly part as I've never had any kind of surgery.

{"id": "Endo_hpzh9o", "text": "age - 34\n\nI've had extremely regular, fairly light, short (3-4 days), &amp; rarely painful periods since starting at age 12. Within the last year, the pain level for periods has gradually increased as well as how heavy my flow is. I went to an ob-gyn several weeks ago who thinks there is a good chance I have endometriosis. I had a vaginal ultrasound that confirmed a lot of small cysts on both ovaries- leading her to believe this may be PCOS (only or as well as endo).\n\nShe wants me to try low dose birth control- that this would be her first choice of treatment for either of those diagnoses- although she can't be 100% sure of either. She did not run blood work to test hormone levels because of how regular my periods have always been. She did say that at my follow-up in 3 months we would reevaluate the treatment and how it's working and do blood work then if I am still having issues.\n\nI am supposed to start the birth control (Lo Loestrin Fe) at my next period- which should be this week. Just today I am feeling the start of painful symptoms. Overlying dull cramps and occasional sharp pain on the lower left abdomen- after the sharp pain I went to the bathroom and had some spotting.\n\nIs it normal for cysts with PCOS to rupture? And could this spotting be a sign of that? Is this worrisome? She gave me the impression that these tiny follicle cysts weren't the type to rupture and cause issues. But it seems odd to have the spotting right after that sharp pain.\n\nAnother side note that I wonder if anyone also has issues with is I have pain in my groin area in connection with menstrual and PMS cramps.

{"id": "Endo_iz4tz9", "text": "Okay, this will be a half rant about shitty doctor care and half 'Anyone have similar' deal of a post as I just need to get all of this out SOMEWHERE. Bless you if you manage to read all of this ramble and there may be a bit of TMI.  \n \n\nI've had a history of ovarian cysts and started on the depo shot about 3 years ago to help with the cyst issues and general period pain. I've had bad period pain in tolerable levels, so only having a period every 3 months was a nice perk. For the first year, having the depo shot was great as my periods all but vanished and the pain with it. Then two years ago, every time I was getting close to needing my depo shot I'd start cramping and have ramped up pain along with inconsistent bleeding. Still sort of tolerable, but not super fun. Sometimes I'd have only spotting for those few weeks, other times I'd bleed for two weeks straight but again all within manageable ranges. \n\nThen this past year, everything seemed to get turned up to 11. I'd have pain weeks out from when my depo shot was due and started to look forward to it as my uterus was making me miserable. I'd get this sharp pain in my left side along with cramps that would radiate down my legs. The pain in my left side also felt like it was always being tugged when I walked and generally makes it uncomfortable to find a good position to sit in.  Bonus fun symptoms include penetration sex being generally painful and clitoral orgasms also causing waves of intense cramps and pain akin to what I've felt when I've had a cyst burst. Very weird, not fun. -10/10, don't recommend. \n\n2020 rolled around and I planned on FINALLY going to a doc about all this, but then a new job/new insurance and COVID pushed this all back. I got an appointment with my general doc's office for a Pap at the start of August with a nurse practitioner, as my general doc is a dude and he's great but not who I want to see when my lady parts get pried open. I tell the nurse of my symptoms, that my depo shot wasn't due until the middle of the month but this left side pain was already causing me grief. She orders an ultrasound to see if I have any major cyst issues, tells me what I have shouldn't be related to my uterus as I'm already on birth control and takes blood and urine samples along with giving me a script for Naproxen to help with the pain.  \n \n\nBlood work, urine, and pap all come back normal. My period has now started and I'm bleeding more than my usual. At this point, I've had a weekend from hell where I spent it in bed cradling a heating pad and crying as my cramps and pain were so intense. I've had it bad before, but not this bad.  \n \n\nThis nurse then proceeds to have the office spam me to come back in to talk about my results. I go in again anyway because hey I still hurt and the anti-inflammatory isn't doing shit for me so I figure I can try to get a better prescription. \n\n Nope! The nurse decides that I must have diverticulitis, even if I tell her now my period has started about three weeks out from when it should and my pain has ramped up dramatically. Another anti-inflammatory is called in for me, Celecoxib and she sends me to the ER with an order for a CT scan to check for diverticulitis. The ER decides to do my Ultrasound as well, as it was scheduled the next day anyway. They dose me up, then I find out that even heavy pain killers ain't shit when you're uterus has betrayed you and you get an ultrasound wand shoved up in there. Needless to say, I am not having a good time and am stuck in the ER for about 6 hours waiting for various results.\n\nThe ultrasound comes back showing nothing. The CT scan comes back showing vague inflammation of the lymph nodes in my gut and I'm told I have Mesenteric adenitis. The ER gives me prednisone and sends me on my way as they figure it's a viral infection.  \n \n\nOf course, the nurse wants another follow up appointment to talk about the scans. I go in, stupidly hoping that this time she'll listen and give me something for the pain. At this point, I've been bleeding for 15 or so days and there is no change in my pain. More blood is drawn and the nurse just tells me all about Mesenteric adenitis while I try to tell her the steroids I was given don't work and the celecoxib doesn't seem to do much either. On the plus side, it's the first day I can get my depo shot injection so I get that while I'm in the office and pray it starts working as it has in the past to make the period from hell stop.  \n \n\nThe following day, I get a message from the doctor's office that my white blood count was insane(most likely due to the steroids) so antibiotics and a higher dose of celecoxib has been called in for me. At this point, my vision is blurry so now I fear whatever infection I have is going for my braaiin. But still bleeding far too much and the cramps never stop, despite my new depo shot injection.\n\nI have a miserable weekend on those new antibiotics completely wrecking my digestive track and my vision gets worse. I finally put two and two together, realizing that my vision seems slightly better when I first wake up but then gets worse...right after I take the celecoxib. At least now I know my brain isn't infected.  \n \n\nI take my antibiotics, vow to never see that nurse again and book an appointment with my ACTUAL primary care doctor. Sadly, he's popular so I don't get to see him until the first week in September. As far as my period goes, it lasted 20 days of light to average bleeding with that pain never diminishing. The feeling of an ice pick being shoved into the left side of my abdomen remains, but the cramps subside and the general pain lessens. I can't say if it was due to my depo shot and/or the antibiotics. All I know is as soon as I'm done with the antibiotics, my body decides to bless me with shingles as icing on the shit cake that is my pain. Still, the side pain remained the worst of the two and the shingles pain is thankfully only around for a week.  \n \n\nI see my primary care doctor, he tells me all of the symptoms are nice and vague. Could be endometriosis, could be the mesenteric adenitis is being stubborn, could be an abscess somewhere in my gut, could be appendicitis as now my pain has moved on to BOTH sides. WHO KNOWS WHAT IT IS, MY BODY IS A MYSTERY. He prescribes the antibiotics again in the hope that it's still an infection as they seemed to help, thankfully puts in a script of tramadol as well, and gives me a referral to a surgeon to look over my scans and floats the idea of exploratory surgery.   \n \n\nI finish up the second round of antibiotics and talk to the surgeon. Again, nothing stands out to him, but another CT scan has been ordered next week to look over everything given the fact that my pain is expanding. On the plus side, both the surgeon and my primary doc believe endometriosis is a possibility.\n\nNow I get the tugging sensation on my left side and pain in my left leg like I normally would on my period. The pain varies in intensity, but never goes away regardless of what pain killers I take. Sometimes it's this strange sensation as if there are tons of bubbles in my abdomen that are going to burst, but never do and feel nothing like intestinal gas bubbles. Other times I feel like my insides are being scraped with a knife and there's always a general underlying cramp sensation that never subsides. As of today, walking now hurts and sitting comfortably is impossible. As bonus symptoms, my appetite is all but gone and nausea is a constant.  \n\n\nIt's just this shit had been going on for two months now and I don't know how much longer I can live like this. I am utterly drained of energy due to the pain and can't sleep comfortably from it either. I'm torn between wanting them to diagnose me with endometriosis or something far more dangerous so I can start trying to TREAT it. I do fear if it's endometriosis, that once that's been declared that'll be it and I'll be expected to live with this.  \n\n\nI frankly, can not in my current state.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/iz4tz9/a_long_medical_journey_and_no_answer/"}

{"id": "endometriosis_gog9fe", "text": "Hello all,\n\nI\u2019ll just preface by saying that I do currently have a gynecologist who hasn\u2019t ruled out endo, and I\u2019ve collected a few referrals to others for a second opinion - I\u2019m by no means asking for a diagnosis here.\n\nI\u2019m 21, and my periods started getting painful when I was around 15 - I remember distinctly when this was, because this was the first time I passed out from pain. Since then, my periods have been awful just about every month. In addition to very heavy (and, for other reasons, what I suspect is abnormal) flow, I have cramps that will consistently make me pass out or vomit, pains in my legs and back, dizziness and weakness to the point where I can\u2019t accomplish much physically and, probably worst of all, a really sharp pain that feels like I\u2019m being penetrated by a knife, that makes any bodily function below the belt near impossible.\n\nOTC pain medications and prescribed NSAIDs have done nothing for me in any combination of dosages. I get some relief from heating pads and TENS units but, during especially bad months, the only thing that\u2019s helped was going to the ER and getting one or two doses of opioids. \n\nI come from a family where some of the women do experience bad menstrual pains, but definitely have that \u201csuck it up\u201d mentality, so nobody\u2019s bothered going to a gynecologist for their pain before. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve heard of any of them having periods like this. When I lived with my mother she was always very understanding and accommodating during my periods, but never really thought much about the pain; she\u2019d say that some women just have \u201crough periods.\u201d\n\nMy gyno is great - she\u2019s always made me feel super comfortable, but I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s done enough to help figure out the source of (or at least manage) my pain. Her main strategy for the past few years has been to put me on different birth control pills. They might lessen the pain for a couple months, but every pill so far has stopped working eventually. She\u2019s ordered bloodwork a few times, and everything has come back normal. I also had a trans-vaginal ultrasound about a year ago to make sure it wasn\u2019t PCOS or any other conditions, and that came back with no visible abnormalities.\n\nIt\u2019s currently 5:30 am and I\u2019ve been laying awake with my heating pad because the pain is keeping me awake. I guess I just want to know - am I overreacting? Do I just have really low pain tolerance? Am I right to want answers, or at least a second opinion on this?

They were always incredibly painful, super heavy, irregular, and would last for sometimes two weeks. It took five years of having my period (I got it at 10) to get on the pill. It helped for a while, but for the last two or three years I\u2019ve been bleeding through pretty much every month. I never really worried about it and just figured my body would never completely regulate, and since my cramps and bloating were better and more regular, I just dealt with it. A few times in my past I ended up in the ER for severe abdominal pain. They always told me it was kidney stones, even though they never found them on the CT scans. They just figured I\u2019d passed them, even though I never felt it. It\u2019s almost always been my right side, though I do get twinges now and then on the left. About two months ago I got CID even though I hadn\u2019t had sex in four or five months, and don\u2019t douche or anything like that. It just happened out of nowhere. I was tested for STDs and all came back negative. It took over a month to get diagnosed because nobody believed me, and told me I just was being dramatic. But I don\u2019t have some of the main symptoms of endo. Sex has always been uncomfortable, but only rarely painful. My belly bloats up, but not as round as some of the girls I see post here. I don\u2019t have the vaginal scarring either. But I can\u2019t get over this pain in my side. It was fairly rare to get it when I was younger, it only happened a few times. But this year it\u2019s been almost constant. I had it for like two months back at the beginning of the year, and then when I ended up getting the infection it came back and hasn\u2019t gone away. I feel like I\u2019m grasping at straws because nobody knows what\u2019s wrong with me, but I\u2019m so tired of being in pain. I\u2019ve been put on the implant to try and help my periods, and the nurses I saw at PP (they were the ones to diagnose my CID) are concerned about it being endo.

I had a little over half of my right ovary removed due to multiple endometriomas. But now I have a dull-sharp pain that comes and goes on my lower left side where my left ovary is located. I did miss 2 days of low estrogen combined birth control pills (using temporarily for a few months to postpone my cycle), so wondering if it's from that, and the pain occurred on the second day that I missed the pill. I have a follow-up appointment for an ultrasound in one month. \n\nHas anyone experienced this ovary pain after laparoscopic surgery? I'm worried this could be another cyst, although my surgeon said that my left ovary was healthy with no cysts. The surgeon did remove extensive lesions in my pelvis and behind my uterus.

Miserable cycles since I was 11.5. Finally got things under control at age 31. Had a couple years of easy cycles, but in the last year and a half (cruelly starting right as I started trying to conceive) I\u2019ve had more painful periods than ever (longer duration and lasting through my periods as opposed to mostly hitting me during the luteal phase and on CD1), and many problems with mid-cycle bleeding (have had in the past but it became much more common). \n\nIn order to aid TTC (trying to conceive, for everyone not on the harrowing path to have a baby with endo), I just completed my first cycle on supplemental progesterone pills (200mg, 1x a day). I\u2019ve had THE EASIEST cycle ever. Spotting way less, boosted mood, sleeping like a baby (I can really struggle with sleep especially during the second half of my cycle), zero skin inflammation, zero sore uterus, zero PMS, zero gas / bubbling gut issues which usually start a few days before period, and my actual pain now that my period has started is about 1/2 of what I\u2019ve been dealing with and is entirely responsive to Advil. Usually I get only pain reduction with Advil and ever get to forget that I\u2019m not cramping for 2-3 days. \n\nI am skipping this coming cycle for trying to conceive but plan on taking the progesterone again anyway as I feel so good. I will keep everyone updated on my progress. Due to my irregular bleeding and some other totally unrelated medical issues I\u2019m having, I may have to shelf TTC for a few months and may opt for going on the POP (progesterone only pill) for a couple months to give my body a break. I\u2019ve had REALLY bad experience on combined contraceptives before and my theory now is that any excess estrogen made things worse and that perhaps I\u2019ve been looking at a lifelong imbalance with low progesterone. \n\nCurious if anyone else is on POP or has ever tried supplemental progesterone with any success.

{"id": "Endo_bbvbbv", "text": "Hi all! New to this subreddit. I am a 25 yo female with a pretty extensive medical history, most of which can be attributed to my hypermobile EDS. I have suffered from pelvic pain (LLQ) for 2 1/2 years.  It kicked off with a ruptured cyst and a visit to the ER. For about 6 months it continued in a pattern. Every 3-4 weeks I would get severe pain that would slowly taper over the course of 1-2 weeks, then the cycle began again. Eventually I made my way to an obgyn who suggested a laparoscopy hysteroscopy to see what was going on. She found extensive adhesions, but no endo. However, she did not do any biopsies. My pcp is a smart ass lady who is double board certified in internal medicine and pathology. She says it's possible that I do have endo, and that it is only microscopic, and not visible to the naked eye. It is worth noting that since the day of my surgery, the pain has been constant- it has not gone below a 4 and can get up to an 8 with me crying and needing to take pain meds. It is always worst on my period, and without depot I will spot for months on end, which makes my pain even worse. At one point, I spotted nearly everyday for about 4 months. I also get insane bloating and look 6 months pregnant, which is fun and fresh. It makes it hard for me to eat dinner somedays because I am so uncomfortable. I struggle with constant lower back pain that is, again, significantly worse on my period or if I'm spotting. Honestly, I probably wouldn't be here if I hadn't discovered Kratom to help me manage the pain. \n\n  \nThe other complicating factor is that after about 2 years from the first er visit, I saw an interventional radiologist. He found that I had a may thurner. It's a compression syndrome so my veins were completely (95%\\~) blocked on the left side and there was significant backflow. This could definitely be the cause of my symptoms. I had stents implanted and it was a v v painful procedure. Normal recovery time is 3-6months, but it *can* take longer (a year-18 months). I'm at about 7 moths post-op rn. Also, EDS means slow healing, so it's still possible that the May thurner surgery could fix me. My Dr was very clear before I got the surgery- I needed to get it because the condition can cause blood clots, but it might not be the cause of my pain.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I guess I have 3 main questions. Is it possible to have endometriosis that is not seen by the naked eye and requires biopsies and a microscope? And does my experience sound like endo is worth pursuing?

{"id": "endometriosis_czc5pc", "text": "So this is my first post here. I\u2019m currently recovering from an endoscopy, and Hysteroscopy. They found polyps in my uterus, and blister endometriosis. I don\u2019t quite know what that means as I haven\u2019t had my post op appointment yet. However why I wanted to talk about bad doctor experience is because the practice that I go to is the first stop for every woman in my small-ish town. Warning kinda long. \n\nMy experience with two doctors at this practice have been HORRIBLE. The first one I saw Dr \u2018A\u2019 I saw once, and she didn\u2019t want to investigate any possible endo, to be fare this was pretty early in my process. The whole time she was dismissive of any pain or discomfort,  and my several ER visits. She told me I had a hormonal imbalance, (didn\u2019t even examine me) and needed to get the IUD, that\u2019s all she would say, every sentence ended with you need to get the IUD. I am very hesitant to do IUD because I\u2019m famous for bad birth control reactions and I was 17 and scared, she did nothing to ease my fears just told me it was IUD or chemically induced menopause. And she couldn\u2019t tell me the IUD for sure would help. That was the last time I saw Dr. A \n\nHowever my mother had a DNC by her, my mother has a chronic pain disorder, she takes opioids. Dr. A refused to give her pain meds after surgery, not while In recovery. not a proscription to take home, because she already \u2018had some\u2019 that\u2019s not how it works she has a amount allotted to take for her everyday pain. She would run out if she was taking more for the DNC pain. And run out she did. \n\nI\u2019ve heard from my aunt that Dr. A almost killed her friend, with internal bleeding after surgery. But I\u2019m not sure how solid that claim is.Now the next doctor my aunts other friend also had a problem with after surgery. Suffice to say I\u2019ve heard through the grape vine the doctors suck to other people to.\n\nNow Dr.S I\u2019ve seen her three times it was a lot of the same, dismissive, pushing IUD. I manage to get a few blood tests, a vaginal altra sound. And I ended up trying 5 different birth controls in a two month period. Horrible reactions. Any time I mention they weren\u2019t helping, she said I needed the IUD. The final appointment I had with her was the worst. My mother was out of town so I went with my boyfriend. She was down right rude. My BC had stoped working, and I had been on my period for two months straight. She told me there was no more test to run, that I either got the IUD or did chemically induced menopause (now at two weeks from 18)  I asked about surgery, no I have no symptoms of endometriosis they would NOT do the surgery. I had EVERY symptom of endo, my symptom lists read like the endo wiki page. I said I\u2019d consider the IUD, but in the mean time I\u2019d like to stop my period. She said have you tried taking three birth control pills at once? Umm no I hadn\u2019t thought of taking more of this awful hormone without asking my doctor first?? She told me to leave, and take three pills a day for five days. Then she left the room. Didn\u2019t even say bye or you can leave now. The whole appointment lasted maybe 10 minutes. When we were leaving my BF actually said \u201cwow that\u2019s how far woman\u2019s medicine has come\u201d I cried for days, she told me that was that and I\u2019d be like this for ever. Five days went by of BRUTAL hormones. I called the office because I was still bleeding. And talked to her nurse. She was reading the appointment notes. Which said to take a break for 5 days, and then take three pills. The notes said I had  adamantly refused surgery when she brought it up. I actually asked the nurse to recheck the notes to make sure it wasn\u2019t someone else appointment. It was so obviously not the appointment we had set through. Nope she lied on her notes! I even asked my BF if he remembered the appointment that way, nope we remember it the same.\n\nI really didn\u2019t want a male doctor, but I finally bit the bullet, and went to Dr.N who was my mothers doctor for a long time, and did my sisters  hysterectomy. The appointment was WILDY different, he told me that day we were doing the surgery, and he\u2019d send in the pre approval papers before the day ended. He talked a little about what we do after surgery, Recommended a different IUD for woman who have never been pregnant. He was amazing, and compassionate. He never even questioned I was in pain. The next time I saw him was my pre op appointment. \n\nSorry this was so long, but my question is what do I do?? These doctors are awful. And have already hurt people. I can\u2019t do anything that would jeopardize, because Dr,N is at the same practice. I feel like so many woman have been hurt by these doctors. What do I do? If you look at the google page for the clinic, the only positive reviews are from woman who where pregnant. The others say that Dr. A and Dr. S should not be practicing medicine. Is there a way to report them secretly? Is this even that bad? I\u2019m just worried.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/czc5pc/handling_experiences_with_horrible_doctors/"}

{"id": "Endo_bepge6", "text": "I understand that surgery is the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis and treatment, but for some people surgery isn't an option *right now*, and even with surgery there is a high probability of endo returning if even the smallest spot isn't removed. Since not everyone has access to specialists, it's likely something will be missed, and hormonal treatment is generally done along side of surgery anyway (either before or after). \n\nDienogest is a progestin medication. It's different from oral contraceptives which use a lower dose of different progestins. Not everyone responds well to progestins, but it's hard to know how you'll respond to dienogest if you've only tried regular oral contraceptives. \n\nIn studies, doenogest is extremely effective \n\n&gt;Laparoscopy showed that dienogest at 2 mg and 4 mg daily **significantly reduced endometriotic lesions**. In addition, dienogest at both these doses improved patient-reported symptoms, including the intensity of dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and diffuse pelvic pain. \n\n[I highly suggest reading this overview for a better understanding of why dienogest is different from other hormonal treatments](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3140813/)\n\nIn my own experience, I went from debilitating pain to almost no pain at all. It completely stopped my period, I no longer have a tight, pulling sensation in my pelvis, and all my other endo symptoms have lessened considerably. I do still have some bloating and pain and occasionally ovulate (I can feel it), but it's nothing like what I was feeling before. \n\nSide effects are minimal, risks are lower than other hormonal treatments (because there is no estrogen) and it is effective long term (unlike other options that have limited use). \n\nIn Canada it's available as Visanne (2mg), but [according to this it's available under other names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dienogest). If you don't have access to surgery right now, you can talk to your doctor about trying dienogest. It might give you some relief until you can have surgery. There is minimal risk to trying it - it's out of your system fairly quickly so withdrawal isn't an issue.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/bepge6/a_defence_of_dienogest_as_a_viable_treatment/"}

{"id": "Endo_dttbf9", "text": "This will be long, my apologies.\n\nBackground: \nI had been seeing the same GYN since I was 16(now 24). He'd diagnosed me with endometriosis without doing a lap, I did the whole birth control pill run around until I found one that didn't make me suicidal. Chronic pelvic pain, semi-regular cyst ruptures (always verified by ultrasounds), I haven't had a period in 8 years. Any bleeding I categorize as breakthrough since I haven't stopped taking the pill. I had a diagnostic Laparoscopy in January of 2018, where two tissue samples were taken  (one that looked like cervical dysplasia, one was a little bump  on back vaginal wall) I assume those aren't really something you'd expect to come back as Endo. Doctor that did the surgery did not show me any images or anything of the procedure, and the two samples came back normal as not Endo.\n\nThe thing is, the doctor has told me verbally (I have not personally been able to obtain a copy of the records, only the biopsy results) that I had severe abdominal adhesions that had glued my intestines to my abdominal wall and that they had corrected it so that I was now \"anatomically correct\". No samples were taken of this scar tissue, the doctor insinuated  that it must have been from an STD that I took too long to treat.Mind you, I had been seen by my gyn every 3 months for the previous 7 years and was not even sexually active when I began seeing them. Tested annually and in a relationship with the same person since I was 17, there's practically no way something like that got missed. I also  never had any sort of surgery prior to the lap. No abdominal trauma, nothing of the sort that could possibly cause adhesions from what I understand, leaving Endo as the only reasonable culprit. My GYN  had all the information from the surgery and stuck by his Endo diagnosis obviously. Adequate pain relief has never been a problem with my GYN, if I had an issue, I made an appointment and there was always something actually wrong that could either be felt during a pelvic exam or seen on an ultrasound, always left with a prescription in hand for oxycodone or hydrocodone.\n\nSo after the lap, Pain decreased significantly. I stayed on The pill and even though I did still have issues with pain every few months, I was in a job that did not allow sick time. I had to either bear it, or lose my job. Fast forward to Summer of 2018, I get a better job and just so happen to start experiencing some intense fatigue. I blame it on the Endo, figured it would go away. It doesn't go away, escalated to the point of falling asleep while standing talking to people. Turns out I have Narcolepsy, get put on some high(above FDA limits) doses of schedule 2 medications to just be able to Live my life. Pain severely messes with the effectiveness of my medication, to the point of definitely not being even close to capable of operating a vehicle, so that did put a damper on getting to the office if no one could take me. \nThe emergency room was technically an option, but as we all have probably experienced...going to the ER for 'lady issues' gets you ignored, invalidated, a huge bill and a drug seeker label just as a -baseline-. Add in the medication that I take every day, I convinced myself that no ER doctor would touch me with a ten foot pole for pain relief. I may have been wrong not to try, but it's not unrealistic to think. Somehow I've been lucky and had the good graces of friends donating me the random 4 or 5 leftover tramadol or Tylenol 3s from various surgeries, which have gotten me through the two most severe flare ups that I would have went to the emergency room for. So all that combined with the lack of available appointments,  I have not been able to make it to my GYN for pain management since right after my laparoscopy.\n\n\n\n\n_Which brings us to now&amp; the reason for posting.\n\n\nThe pill that has been \"working\" for me has been discontinued by the manufacturer. I get an appointment, apparently IUD is the only thing that is an option for discussion, okay, whatever, I'd looked into it beforehand and didn't see a problem with this route. Decides sticking with the same progestin I'd been taking (norgestrel, the low dose wasn't discontinued, just the 50 microgram dose) in combination with the iud is probably the best bet. During this appointment , my gyn and I had discussed me having narcolepsy and I had also explained that despite having Endo flare ups, I was too afraid to go to the ER when he wasn't available because I felt that I would not get any help anyway. I explained how the flare ups impact my condition. He validated my concerns, it was a good chat. That was the norm. I'd had no bad experiences with him and trusted him immensely, enough to even refer friends to him.\n\n\n\n\nThis past Friday (nov1) I go to get the mirena placed. I was nervous about insertion pain and had requested conscious sedation. When I get there, change of plans, here's some Valium(side note: it was not even taken into account that I take a -fuck ton- of CNS stimulants every day that would probably render Valium useless)  I expressed my concerns and was told that it wouldn't be that bad and that the Valium would still calm me down....which wasn't what I was concerned about, I just wanted to not be in pain if I was given the option to not experience it in the first place. I decided that wasn't my hill to die on and that I've probably experienced worse. Insertion goes as fine as it could, I cursed a lot and got dizzy after but it wasn't the end of the world.  The end of the world pain started about 7 minutes later, I was having intense cramps that felt like what I assume contractions feel like. I walk out of the exam room, holding my stomach and said to  the nurse 'oh man, it's angry', at that point it as on par with a cyst rupture level of pain. She tells me to go sit in the waiting room and wait them out, so I do. Cramping gets worse, to the point where I am sobbing and asking explicitly for pain medication. I didn't give a hoot what it was, just make it stop. Honestly I would have accepted a shovel to the back of the head.\n\nMy boyfriend was in the waiting room with me, he was beyond worried because he's never seen me so hysterical. I'm hysterical because I had never been brought to tears by pain. I assume my body  makes me faint before that point. My GYN comes out and immediately asks if I want Percocet, my response was \"I don't care what it is,  I can't do this\".  From this interaction, I have literally no idea what happened to cause this complete redirection. In response, he goes on this whole lecture about how he placed the IUD perfectly and it was literally impossible for me to be experiencing pain, and that in the thousands of insertions he's done, no one has ever complained of pain after. He told me sometimes when his back hurts he uses a hot water bottle and takes some naproxen and that helps, and sometimes maybe it's just the Valium wearing off. He walks away, and at that point it's sinking in that I have to stay in this much pain. The cramps are so insane that I can't move, and I couldn't wrap my head around basically being told that it was psychosomatic. \n\nMy boyfriend for me out of the office and to the car, he calls my dad (a nurse) and lets him know that there is a problem and we're on our way over. My dad sees the shape I'm in and is not okay with the fact that I was allowed to leave the office like that. I tried to explain what happened and my boyfriend filled in the gaps because I couldn't make words.\nAt that point it's been about an hour since I left the office.  My dad  calls the office (which it was documented he's allowed to do) and wants to know what happened/if something was misinterpreted, and to ask why I was allowed to leave in tears. He only got as far to say he was calling on my behalf, that that my boyfriend brought me over and that I was in excruciating pain. My GYN cut him off and condescendingly explained the procedure of how IUDs get placed and would speak over any attempt to explain what was happening, and told him the same thing about how because it was perfectly placed I can't be experiencing pain and that he's never had a patient have anything like this happen, and ends the conversation.\n\nSo you can probably guess after this I do not feel comfortable continuing to be his patient, or really stepping foot in that practice ever again. I have never been made to feel so sub-human and so invalidated by a doctor. I've never had a reason not to trust him, I've never given a reason for me not to be trusted either. I can't stop replaying the day in my head and wondering what I did wrong.\n\nSo now I have to find a new GYN.\nBy Sunday night the crying level pain went down to a 6/10 as long as I take enough ibuprofen and Tylenol to risk organ damage, with cute bursts of cramps that make me get dizzy and black out. It's stayed at that level since, and I'm an absolute wreck because my stimulants are hardly working and I'm depending on my boyfriend for everything (he's a blessing and doesn't mind). work has been hell, I passed out/fainted twice at my desk this week and have been having nonstop sleep attacks. I've called a few different doctors offices to see if they're taking new patients and if they treat Endo, and no calls back so far. \n\n On Wednesday I went to my local planned Parenthood to see if the iud had moved or was misplaced or something was wrong, I was hoping they could do something for me or even take the thing out. They were wonderful and sweet, the IUD was in fine but my body might just hate the thing. They caught that I had a yeast infection that was asymptomatic and got me antibiotics, and they said that could be aggravating everything as well and making my body go into hyperdrive. They have me a list of gyns in the area and made some personal recommendations.

She says it's definitely not from my heating pad, and it's nothing to be worried about but doesn't know what it is. I think, \"hmm.. Okay well...

{"id": "Endo_apypfw", "text": "Not sure where to start with this. It first came to my attention before I was diagnosed with endo when I was 22-23ish. A coworker of mine pointed out that I tended to make more 'careless' mistakes about every other 3rd week. They were mentoring me and (inadvertently, not directly) helped me realize the pattern between my body making it physically hard to work but also my brain/cognition lagging as well. It was a highly data driven job that involved a lot of moving tasks, where I had a really great reputation for being one of the best, yet a close mentor noticed a drop in my numbers and spike in small errors that aligned with my cycle. They were mostly blown off and I as told to \"just slow down and re-read/double check/etc\" because millennial's are always forgetting to do that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward.. I'm almost 29 and I'm approaching my one year anniversary at what I truly consider to be my dream job and things are going great. But I'm growing a paranoia because I'm still making errors once every 3 weeks or so and I can tell my boss is noticing. She has been married for about 30 years, has two kids, and is an incredibly kind and intelligent woman and she's been nothing but sweet about any mistakes I've made and definitely hasn't put together the correlation between my mensuration and my errors. When it comes to \"woman stuff\" she's by far the best boss I've had. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me shed some light on the details: I'm currently taking my birth control pills consistently (skipping the placebo pills) for 4 months at a time, but I still get some \"foggy-brain\" symptoms during the week leading up to the placebo pills. I'm generally pain free because I follow this method. Yet I still seem to have problems in the week leading up to what would be my period week: I physically bump into things and knock things over, I blush more easily and my palms are sweaty, I make small mistakes like attaching the wrong thing to emails (or not attaching anything at all), or don't catch spelling errors, or completely forget something on my to-do list that should have been easy to remember. I forget to double check myself, I make clerical errors, and I'm not as detail oriented - Not for lack of effort.. I just double check things and STILL manage not catch glaring errors...ugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fear is that I'll develop a reputation for  not being detail oriented - when really, I AM! I promise! - But I seem to make the dumbest mistakes once a month.. which any normal boss/manager/mentor would tally up and chop it up to me being a millennial/careless/not detail oriented/not as reliable as other employees etc. My current boss, lovely as she is, has mentioned on a few occasions that I 'make mistakes a lot' in regards to to-do lists, and I need to 'slow down and check my attachments'.. things that prior bosses have said too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat sucks is I'll go three weeks without making ANY errors, then the third week of my pill pack comes and it's like my brain shuts down.. and in summary I'm unreliable despite the prior weeks without any mishaps. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst part is I typically don't realize the mistakes/errors I've made until my 'brain fog' has lifted the following week. I start catching my mistakes - which shouldn't have happened or regularly would have been caught before they happened - hello my brain is back on.. ugh - So then either I catch them and need to apologize or someone else catches them and I'm even more embarrassed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want my boss to know she can rely on me -  that I'm not some 20-something bimbo who fucks shit up because she's moving too fast. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes this happen to anyone else?

But I\u2019d get awful cysts that would always rupture and I\u2019d end up in the ER. \nI got put on birth control at a young age because my mom wanted me to be safe. I still had cysts rupture, had symptoms of IBS, got my gallbladder, appendix and a cyst on my Fallopian tubes removed. \nI got off birth control about 2 years ago because of severe blood clots and mood swings.  almost immediately I started experiencing terrible fatigue, back and leg pain.

I was in the ER EVERY MONTH and they couldn\u2019t find any infection or anything wrong so they\u2019d send me home with Tylenol.

I am also married to my Jr High sweet heart and he is my supporter. I freaking love the man. \n\nI fought with 3 OBGYNs at my local hospital in my home city in IL to finally search for endo. I had my appendix removed in Oct 2015 but all 3 OBGYNs refused to see that the Lap done then showed signs of Endo. I finally found my saving grace Gyn that finally did the lap and unfortunately the damage was already done. Some endo isnt gone because it did hit sensitive organs like my fallopian tubes, small intestines, and parts of my bladder. It is traveling unfortunately, like attaching to my abdominal wall and moving up, and suppressants have been keeping some symptoms at bay and is hopefully slowing the growth. I had the nexplanon as a suppressant for 3 years and recently switched to depo after Lupron failure. It failed due to my current mental state and previous history of suicidal ideation. Unfortunately endo doesn't help much mentally but I try to keep a positive mind. I do work full time as a janitor at my local university so, if you also work thru the pain I sympathize with you too!\n\nI'm also a huge advocate with using medical marijuana however, I'm in a legal state and dont want anyone to feel like they have to try it if they are in an illegal state.

I\u2019m not trying to speak for her, I\u2019m just trying to vent and maybe find some help/someone to talk to. Sorry for the wall of text. I\u2019m on mobile, trying to sleep on the couch, listening to my gf moan in pain in our bed. She knows I\u2019m posting this info and has consented. \n\n     When C (my gf) and I met, we basically both decided this was it and just dove into a relationship so quickly and passionately that finding out she had Endo/PCOS happened within the first 2 dates. I had never known of its existence until then. 4 years later, we\u2019ve got an apartment with a back yard for our puppy, and life couldn\u2019t be better. Carley is on BC that keeps her period number down to 4 a year so she doesn\u2019t have to suffer as much pain as she would. That\u2019s about to all change because of my dumb ass. \n\n     C\u2019s periods were HELL. She couldn\u2019t work, she\u2019d vomit from the pain, and occasionally even faint from severe pain (in her mind she thought this had to be from a cyst bursting or something) and I just had to stand by and watch the love of my life go through what looks like the most excruciating thing one could go through. I needed to not see that shit happen any more. In hopes of helping out with her overall health, I started researching Endo/PCOS as well as attending her Gynecologist appointments (she\u2019s the type to forget to ask questions and forget the answers to questions she remembered to ask) with her permission. We found out that she could have a surgery that would cure her Endo for 3-5 years (PCOS was apparently under control from her BC?... timeline blurry.) This was basically all they said they\u2019d be willing to do at this point in her life, so if it doesn\u2019t fix things then she\u2019d have to tough it out until she\u2019d be old enough to have her grapefruit scooped out. \n\n     Fuck it let\u2019s do it. Surgery \u2705 pain meds \u2705 happy C \u2705  happy me \u2705 \n\n     That was super short-lived. By the time her second period came around (off old BC, on new one that is supposed to help, but ruins her life every month now) she was worse than before. They said the surgery worked out well, those god damn scammers.\n\n     After going back to her doctor to get an explanation, she came home sobbing, barely able to get out the words that she wrote down at the appointment (at least she\u2019s improving somewhere!) Dr. told her she probably doesn\u2019t have Endo or PCOS and she should go find like 20 different specialists under her insurance plan to get a whole cavalcade of tests done. \n\n     She feels hopeless, obviously (What\u2019s new amirite? \ud83d\ude05) but,  she also feels like a fraud. She feels like an imposter. In her mind, I think since she doesn\u2019t have a way to explain the pain any more, then it\u2019s not valid. She also feels like she\u2019s been lying to everyone this whole time and that the pain could all be in her head. Bullshit. I\u2019ve held her to keep her from falling as her eyes roll back and her body goes limp. I\u2019ve watched her writhe in pain for 4.5 years. It\u2019s real pain, but nobody knows why it\u2019s happening.\n\n     She\u2019s missing work more than ever, she\u2019s depressed again, and I\u2019m leaving for a few months at least (grandmothers dying of cancer, family can\u2019t afford care taker, you do the math, ya dingus!) right as she starts going in to see doctor after doctor to get tested for god knows what! Perfect timing!!! Thanks Universe!\n\n     Anyways, if you have gotten this far, I\u2019d love to hear your story, and maybe get some advice/words of encouragement I can pass on to C this week while she starts going to meet new doctors and spends some time with me before I travel 1000 miles away for an undisclosed amount of time in a week or two.

I wake up in pain every single morning. The mornings are actually the worst for me personally (how about you guys?). That\u2019s when my stomach issues are extra brutal, I feel very weak and lightheaded, I\u2019m exhausted/never feel like I\u2019ve gotten enough sleep, my head *kills* me, my cysts stab me, my endo flares, I\u2019m bloated, etc. I never wake up ready to greet the day- instead, I wake up with two hours to spare for work every morning just so I have enough time to take painkillers, roll around in bed groaning, wait for the pills to kick in, painfully use the bathroom, and then limp through my morning routine. \n\nIt makes me so mad. I know, I know...at least I AM waking up every day. I should be grateful I can walk, and hear, and see, and somewhat function on a daily basis even if it\u2019s riddled with pain. I feel like I\u2019m complaining. But no longer having that one *stupid* luxury that I never even realized was a luxury- **waking up pain-free and excited to tackle the day while feeling well-rested**- is something I never thought would infuriate me this much. \n\nI just want to wake up with no headaches, no stabbing pelvic pain, no back pain, no bloat, no digestive discomfort, no fatigue, nothing. \n\nDamn dude.

{"id": "Endo_b0c4y7", "text": "Hey guys, I've lurked on this forum as well as a few others pertaining to chronic illnesses.  I suffer from an autoimmune thyroid disorder and a currently diagnosed menstrual disorder.\n\nSince I got my first period (which was fairly early), my menstrual cycles have been irregular and severe. Debilitating cramps, periods that last up to two weeks, bleeding in between periods, the whole 9 yards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, logically, I get referred to a OBGYN to get things sorted out.  An ultrasound reveals a my endometrial lining is too thick, and I'm subsequently put on the pill, which was an absolute fail for me.  It didn't improve much of anything and I put on weight like it was my job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, plan B: the Depo Provera injection. Guys, when I tell you this was my miracle cure I mean it.  It worked perfectly for me; relieved my symptoms and (since I have a thyroid disorder and have to get blood work fairly frequently) I had absolutely no issue with getting my injection every 3 months. \n\nI stayed on it for as long as my doctor permitted, and then was given the choice of the IUD or a Nexplanon implant. And this is where the real problem begins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI choose the Nexplanon as I know two people with it and they loved it, they told me it was great and so my mother made me the appointment. Insertion went smoothly, no infection, and we think everything's just peachy.\n\nAnd then it hits.  Bleeding with no warning or schedule, the most painful cramps I've ever experienced, more weight gain, and acne when I hardly ever even got a pimple before.\n\nI can't even begin to count the days where I was sent home from school because I began to bleed with no warning and easily bled through the panty liner I was required to wear EVERY, SINGLE, DAY. \n\nWe return to the OBGYN and she tells me it's most likely just my body adjusting, which sounds fair enough to my mom and I.  She writes me a prescription for some Motrin and sends me on my way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis brings me to my current situation, I've had my Nexplanon for a  little over 8 months now and my health is deteriorating.  I'm having cramps more severe than before I was put on anything, and I constantly bleed on and off with no warning.\n\nAnother return to my OBGYN ends in absolute heartbreak for me.  Whether she didn't believe me, thought I was over exaggerating, or just didn't care, I'm not sure. The conversation went a little like this.\n\nMe: \\*Explains everything I've previously typed\\*\n\nHer: That's normal.  You're still adjusting.\n\nMe: I don't think so, this is worse than before I was on anything, and I'm past the normal \"adjusting\" period.\n\nHer: I think you should wait until it's been a year and then we'll discuss the IUD.\n\nMe: Actually I think I may need another ultrasound, my family has a history of ovarian cysts.\n\nHer: Mmm, no, I don't think so. I can't do anything unless your condition is impacting your daily life.\n\nMe: It is! I haven't stayed a full week at school because I either double over with cramps or bleed through my jeans because I have no clue when any of this will hit me.\n\nHer Then just wear a pad every day. \\[Those were her exact words\\]. Here's some prescriptions for oral Provera and more Motrin.\n\nShe doesn't ask me to rate my pain and she doesn't even bother to feel my pelvis or gut. And obviously I left the office sobbing, because I felt like an idiot. My mom fills my prescription and I start the Provera. Thankfully, my bleeding stops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to Sunday night.  I'm up til 4 AM with a whole new type of pain I've never felt before. I'm not concerned about the fact that I'm unable to sleep due to the pain (happens more often then I'd like to admit), what I am concerned with is that it is a new type of pain. I finally get to sleep and when I wake up to  go to school, I can't even finish showering because of the pain, so I go back to bed.\n\nIt's hard for me to describe, but my \"normal\" cramps feel like someone has a fistful of my organs and is just twisting them around.  This pain was more like when you've done too many sit-ups and your core muscles can't relax. \n\nIt doesn't go away for the rest of the day and gets much worse when I sit or stand, so I'm bedridden until 8 PM when I figure maybe an ER trip is in order. Get there and the doctor is incredibly sympathetic and takes me very seriously.  She explains that there's no one to perform an ultrasound at this time of night, so she instead has me go for a CT scan and orders some blood work.\n\nBoth come back normal, I have absolutely no cysts or fluid indicating that I may have had one that busted.  The ER doctor tentatively suggests Endo but says she cannot do anything with that, my only option is to follow up with my OBGYN.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then gives me some Tylenol 3 to take, writes a prescription for more, and sends me home with two school excuses.  When I get home the pill knocks me out cold and I wake up today at 11, and my pain is now barely a dull ache...until I get out of bed to make myself something to eat.  The pelvic pain comes back with vengeance, along with back and leg pain.\n\nNot only that but I've began to bleed again after 2 weeks of Provera, when I'm not supposed to start until my I'm done with my prescription (She wrote a month supply).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm at a total loss of what to do at this point. I'm stuck in bed or at my desk where my heating pad cord can reach.  I'm a senior in high school and simply can't afford to miss any more school, even if it is excused, because I'm already too far behind to catch up at a reasonable pace. I'm a distinguished student with exclusively AP, Honors, and Dual Enrollment classes, so you can see how I've fallen behind so badly.  \n\nI have to prepare to go to a college 3 hours away, without my mom (a retired nurse who once worked in an OBGYN office, so she's practically my personal carer when I'm ill)\n\nI don't know what to say when I go for my follow-up.  I'm afraid if I'm too direct and say \"look, I'm 99% sure I have Endo and something has to be done about it\" she'll think I'm diagnosing myself, drug seeking (I live in WV, where prescription and opiate addiction is more common than flies), or something else along those lines.\n\nThis is affecting my mental health at this point too, it's enhancing my anxiety disorder and major depression that I was already struggling with.\n\nI've read the statistics. I know it takes an average of 8 years and multiple doctors simply to get diagnosed, and I'm just not sure I can handle that.  I know I definitely can't get through college if this is what I have to deal with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm asking for any advice or support I can get.  At this point I'll try anything. I know you guys are super supportive and helpful to each other so hopefully I can find some comfort here.\n\nIf you read through all of this thank you so much, I didn't expect to type so much of an essay but here we are4\n\n&lt;3\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/b0c4y7/confused_and_looking_for_support/"}

One of my relatives spoke to this nutrionist over the phone to ask what their practice is like. At no time during this phone call did the nutrionist disclose that they are strongly spiritual and that they integrate this heavily in their practice. The reason I want to see a nutrionist is because a) I am defiecent in many nutrients due to constant naseua/vomiting due to abdominal pain from endo and long standing stomach problems b) have lost a lot of weight in the last year, to a point where I was almost on a feeding tube. \n\nSo I call the nutrionist for my first appointment, expecting this phone call to be more less about my medical history. This is part of the appointment, but then after 5min she starts getting into her being a spiritual intuitative and that in order to succeed I need to be open minded to this. I was WAY TOO NICE during this phone call. She proceeds to 'pick up on things', like your favorite color is blue and that you are a sensitive person, et. bullshit etc. \n\nI'm just kind of saying \"ya you're totally right\" when she says these things as I'm multitasking. I should have told her I'm not interested then and there. One hour into the phone call, and we have discussed my medical history and current medications. That is when I tell her \"oh ya I have an IUD too\", just to have all my bases covered. \n\nShe doesn't make a comment on this right away, but after 10min talking about something else she circles back to the IUD. She says,  \"don't you think that was the wrong decision to be on the IUD?\". I say \"no, without the IUD I wouldn't be able to function\". She also lectured me about lawsuits against this IUD (mirena) and the artifical hormones that it is constantly pumping into your body. Eventually, she goes back to her spiritual intituativeness and says, \"I'm just really picking up that your body is screaming for the IUD to 'GET OUT'\".  There were also some comments mixed in there like, \"you're too young to be on so many medications\" and \"the diagnosis you have of endo is probably because of your IUD sideffects\". I was diagnosed with endo prior to getting an IUD. That's when I really couldn't take her seriously and almost lost my shit. I should have hung up then or very least ended the conversation. If you make a comment like that to me I can't take your actual nutrition recommendations seriously. \n\nThis post isn't to shame people who use nutrionists or doctors with a spiritual background, this particular person crossed a line with me and will not be getting any more of my business. Super shady that they did not disclose their spiritual focus during a pre-appointment interview as well, big red flag there. Just wanted to rant and hopefully share my experience.

Basically, I can always feel when I am ovulating or anything is going on down there. Often feel bloated and have many bowel issues anytime I feel activity/pain in my lower abdomen. I am often  fatigued. My mother suffered from endometriosis and eventually had a hysterectomy at 35. After talking with her about my symptoms she seemed to think I have endo. My GP referred me to a gynaecologist after discussing my symptoms. I had been to this gyno previously because I had abnormal cells show up on my pap and has to get them frozen off my cervix. Anyways, I get an ultrasound and receive my results. The doctor saw something weird and didn\u2019t know what it was. He said it could be adenomyosis or some sort of growth. So I went for another ultrasound and they booked me for an MRI. After both of those I went back to the gyno and he said there was nothing there, maybe a small spot of endo on one Fallopian tube. After my first visit to my GP she prescribed me the lowest hormonal birth control you can get (Lolo). It helped for awhile but since then I just feel physically ill and am in pain. The gyno asked me how my pain was and just told me to stay on my birth control. I get severe anxiety and it doubles when I am on hormonal birth control. I have been able to handle it this time with medication and therapy. I have tried the Mirena. It was a total disaster and makes me totally paranoid about putting anything else in my body. \n\nI have researched this a lot and my understanding is that ultrasounds and MRIs can show no results. The only real way of knowing if you have endo is to get a lap. At this point I don\u2019t know if I should ask my GP for a referral to a different gyno, as the first one basically said it was in my head. Should I continue to peruse a diagnosis? \n\nTL; DR: Have had multiple ultrasounds and a MRI and they show no endo. Still in pain. Should I ask for a second opinion?

This is the first time i am posting something on reddit and i hope it reaches a couple of people.\nI never thought i would ever have to make a post like this or even live the life i have been living for months now but here i am haha\nThis might be a little long but i will try to keep it as short as possible- \nOn 6th december 2018 i had sex with my boyfriend for the first time. On 8th june i took an i pill (its an emergency contraception). From 13th of that month i started developing sharp sudden pains in lower abdomen and did not quite understand what that was so i went to a gynaecologist, she gave me some medication for uti. It was not much of a help so i went to another gynac and she gave me antibiotics. Those were not much useful either. Another thing is my vaginal discharge has decreased a lot and is usually thin. Most of the times its infact watery. Once i do remember it even had a streak of blood on it (but this could be normal).\nOn feb 9th, i ended up passing blood in my stool once. I also got my period 3 hours later. I was given some antibiotics which helped my stool get back to normal but these pains still persisted. They even became constant for a few days so i was confused what was the underlying cause. \nThey ran lots of tests and everything came back normal. Only thing they found was a urine infection for which i was given antibiotics again. \nI did see that the pains went away for a few days after the treatment but then it could be a coincidence because my pains did fluctuate.\nAfter they came back, they were persistent. It would usually happen worse early morning. \nI have been diagnosed with a uti again and even been given medication through iv but i literally found no help. I get chronic discomfort in my pelvic area and sharp sudden pains anywhere in my abdomen sometimes even in the back. \nI am literally so confused with almost no answers. \nI had considered post infectious ibs but these dont seem to be affected by my diet, neither do i get diarhhea or constipation.\nYes, i do get gassy but thats probably because of the multiple times i have been put on antibiotics. \nI am so tired of being in pain chronically. This last month i have also noticed i have being more often but still found no help from uti medication. I still have to get a routine done post my last course of iv antibiotics\nHonestly, is it even possible for uti to present like this? I dont think so and hence i have been very confused. Please help.

I also have a blood disorder that causes me to not be able to take any birth control that is estrogen based. So yeah. But anyways.\nI have never been officially diagnosed with endo, but through working with my wonderful and caring gynecologist since 2016 (sophmore-junior year), we've narrowed it down to endo being the most probable. I've been through Lupron shots, progesterone pills, I have the 5 year IUD (Kyleena, if I'm not mistaken), and I still get in serious pain.\nBut there are times, when I read other people's stories and hear people talk of their pain, or when I'm having a good day and only hurt a little/only feel a little tired, that I wonder if it's all in my head? I have an ultrasound scheduled for Monday (18th) and my laparoscopy consultation scheduled for Wednesday (27th), so hopefully I'll find out soon if I really have endo, but I can't get the thought out of my head that maybe I'm just weak, or that maybe there's something mentally wrong with me, or whatever.\nThankfully I have a wonderful boyfriend who's there for me, and caring parents. And I can realize that there are things that people who aren't sick can do that I can't, like stand in a shower without getting dizzy and having to sit down, or not having to call into work a lot, or not feeling like their legs are going to fall off if they keep standing for any longer than an hour at work without stopping and sitting, or at least crouching down. I relate a lot to the spoon theory, which I have heard of but just recently looked into, and I feel that may be the best way to explain my issues to my family and boyfriend and friends a lot more, because I also have the feeling that they don't understand as much as I need them to.\n\nBut yeah.

Well, shortly after posting that I had a number of doctors walked into my room and basically told me they were missing a cotton swab and they may have left it inside of me. The surgical assistant wasn\u2019t sure and wanted to be extra safe (and also probably didn\u2019t want to get sued/fired) so they decided to X-ray me.\n\nThey X-rayed my pelvis on the exact spot where my cyst was and they found a \u201cneedle shaped object\u201d.\n\nQueue the panic. Being told you may have a potentially lethal object floating around your body, terrifying. But because I wasn\u2019t able to stand from the pain and had been in my bed and partially X-rayed, the needle shaped object may be in the bed, gown or on my outside body. \n\nSo after changing my gown and dressing I have another X-ray and it\u2019s still showing a needle shape. This is when I start to really panic. \n\nI was being told to prepare to potentially go to theatre again. \n\nAnother 2 X-rays after my catheter and drain was take out (fucking ouch by the way, by far the worst pain) and the object is still there from every angle they look at. Doctor is confused because she said no needles were used in the operation. Radiologists are definite it\u2019s a foreign object so now I\u2019m sent for a CT scan to get a really good look at whatever is in my body.\n\nSo I have the CT scan and senior radiologists from another hospital have been called to have a look, I have been seen by maybe 30-40 medical staff today. After around 2 hours of them looking through each layer of the scan they are able to say it is part of the inside of my bone which is essentially shaped to look like a needle and none of them have ever seen anything like it before. I can\u2019t remover the correct terminology but it was something to do with my bone structure. \n\nAnd that was it! \n\n48 hours of not being able to eat because they weren\u2019t sure if I was going into theatre again! A whole day of worry and uncertainty and not being allowed to stand/move if said object is sharp and damages my insides and it was nothing all along! Pro tip: if you think you may have a needle floating in your body don\u2019t google it because you will end up thinking you\u2019re about to die.\n\nIncredible team of staff though.  If it weren\u2019t for their diligence, I could\u2019ve had  an infection from a  dangerous object floating around my body. They really went above any beyond. The staff said it was one of the strangest days/situations they\u2019ve seen at the hospital(probably not but it\u2019s always funny to feel important :P)\n\nI hope you all found this interesting/insightful!

My doctor thinks I most likely have Endo and has said we are \u201cmost likely headed to surgery (excision).\u201d I\u2019m 26. \n\nThere are two things making me feel crazy right now.\n\n1. I have had bad periods my entire menstruating career (lol). With awful, have to leave work and school cramps, diagnosed PMDD, and just overall misery. I\u2019ve tried all birth control, I can\u2019t take estrogen because of migraines and have the Skyla IUD right now. HOWEVER, in the past year or so my symptoms have gotten progressively worse. My cramps are getting to the point where I\u2019m immobile, crying and whimpering I\u2019m fetal position AFTER taking tramadol. I\u2019ve developed sciatic pain, extending down to my knees. I get aching and cramps after sex now. (Had sex on Sunday and I am still feeling achey.) And as of the past two months the aching I used to get in my rectum only during my period is constant. It never goes away. Overall I\u2019ve hit pain milestones in my life, my periods got increasingly worse around 17, 21, and then 25 and faster progression since then. \n\nI have to keep telling myself that worsening symptoms are not in my head, but the nature of this disease. \n\n2. My mother. She\u2019s insistent that my IUD is what is causing all of this, when in fact it\u2019s the only thing that helps my heavy periods and keeps me regular. She doesn\u2019t believe I have it, even though she was diagnosed in her forties. She says I\u2019m too young and it\u2019s not bad enough for surgery. I\u2019m hoping my doctor at Mayo can talk her down from her high horse. I love my mother and we are very close, she\u2019s just stubborn and wants to do what is right for me, but she makes me feel like a hypochondriac.\n\nTLDR; new symptoms within the past year and my mother have me feeling like a hypochondriac/it\u2019s all in my head. \n\nI guess I would like to know if you also had symptoms that got worse as you got older?

{"id": "Endo_ecfaoz", "text": " \n\nI posted this in r/endometriosis too. \n\nSorry, English is not my first language and this could be long. I was diagnosed 11 years ago after a long battle with what a lot of doctors thought was IBD. I was in constant pain, lost a lot of school hours but was really relieved after my first laparoscopy. They found a huge chocolate cyst that destroyed my left ovary, put me on meds and I had a second surgery to remove the ovary. My bowel was really damaged by adhesions and since then I have to take a really clean diet to not have pain, but my life quality has been improving over the years.\n\nNow, I've been on Vissanne for years, we tried with different treatments but it's the only thing that keeps me pain free. I was worried about all this years with hormonal treatment, but my doctor (the one that made my diagnosis and has been treating me all this years) told me that it was up to me, we tried and nothing else worked. I asked about side effects and I did my research, and together we decided to keep on going with Vissanne.\n\nI had to change doctors this year, our public health system now has Vissanne and to have access I need to get my medical examinations on their clinics. They gave me 6 months of Vissanne and on my last appointment I had the luck (no quite sure) to be with a doctor that suffers endo herself. She was horrified about how long I've been taking Vissanne, she even make me feel bad about my decisions, and she sent me to next level to see if I'm candidate to another laparoscopy.\n\nOn one side, I understand the side effects of long hormonal treatments and this could be a great opportunity to explore different options, on the other hand, I'm really tired of doctors, meds and pain, and don't want to start all over again, when I'm quite well at the moment. I don't know if another surgery it's a good option and don't have the resources to look for help outside of the public system (I'm Mexican btw).\n\nI'm just venting my frustration, I'll be seeing the laparoscopy specialist in January and if they recommend another surgery, I'll look for another opinion. After all this years, I still feel that not a lot of people understand how emotional challenging this could be, I have an amazing support system, but feel that you sisters are what I need right now.\n\nThank you all, stay strong and have a really Happy Holidays.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/ecfaoz/another_laparoscopy_in_my_way_im_exhausted/"}

(started menstruating at 13, now nearly 23)\n\nA thought came to mind about my frequent hospital visits as a young child, the ages of apprx. 6-12. It was always the same symptoms I experience now, that have been linked to my endo. The doctors did countless tests and I tried countless remedies and nothing helped. The pain was more intense back then but I assume that has something to do with my pain tolerance rising over time. So I guess really where i'm really heading with this is do you think this could have been my endo symptoms rearing their ugly head? Can endo affect you before you're actually menstruating?

I was given the choice by my gyno to get the laprascopy or have the mirena inserted, and I went with the mirena. What followed was about three months of agonising pain, a few hospital visits and me pretty unable to do much at all, constantly drugged up on tramadol and dealing with cramps. Thankfully, the longer i held out the more my pain became managable, and i am down to about 1-2 days a week of pain bearable when I take codeine. \n\nThe problem: my boyfriend was there throughout those months, taking me to and from hospital and doctor visits, supporting me so much. Without him i don't know how i would have gotten through. Obviously this put a huge strain on him and our relationships, but we have made it through. Now though, he is seemingly unsympathetic towards my pain, as he is very tired of feeling like he has to look after me, even though he doesn't really have too that much anymore. This morning though, I woke up in a very painful state. As in I was holding back tears and couldn't really move. He was being very cold to me, and in turn it was making me more miserable, as I felt so ashamed of myself for being a burden on him. I apologised and he said 'it's okay this is just the two hundredth time this has happened, and i've already said everything that i could say to support you.' this was hard to hear as I would have been happy with just 'i love you' or something but I guess he really is just tired of it. This made me feel more of a burden and in turn become more of a burden, sobbing unctrollably and the like. He dropped me home, apologised for being cold, I apologised for being a mess myself and we agreed that there needs to be a change on either side. I just feel a bit overwhelmed right now and my self esteem is very low as I can see how much I have tired him out. We both still love eachother and want this to work. I guess what I'm looking for right now is maybe some advice on how to handle these situations, me being in pain around him, that will benefit both of us. Or some insight onto how you guys navigate chronic pain and relationships. Or really anything at all, i'm super lost here.

I am very fortunate to live in a large metropolitan city and to have specialists in my area.\n\nIt was such a difference to have a caring and patient doctor. He reviewed all my symptoms and records, asked me a lot of questions about the nature of my pain and other symptoms. Then he performed a very exhaustive pelvic exam, testing and pulling on my pelvic muscles, ovaries, uterus, bladder, etc. He also did a rectal exam.\n\nHe found two painful spots, the \"Pouch of Douglas\", and my right ovary, which has a small dermoid cyst and an endometrioma according to ultrasounds.

It was brutal, it was like if he pressed a button and it just irradiated burning knifes in my pelvis.\n\nHe said that due to the pain in the Pouch of Douglas and my history/symptoms it is like 90% likely that I have endo, and plans to schedule excision surgery. He is also going to excise the ovarian cysts in my right ovary and is going to test for IC when I am under anesthesia. He assured me that he will look closely at all my abdominal cavity and diaphragm to make sure he doesn't miss any endo.\n\nI explained to him my doubts since I already have been through a laparoscopy that I feel was a waste of time and money. He explained that unless you're trained in endo, you're not going to find those difficult to see spots. I also told him that my previous doc refused to remove the ovarian cyst since \"it was too small to be the cause of the pain and didn't want to affect my fertility\" but this Nook doctor doesn't seem to be concerned about fertility as much as just endometriosis and patient care, which is very reassuring to me.\n\nHe is booked for surgery for months, so I will have to sit and wait.

Sorry about that... I found a method of pain management that has basically eliminated my endo pain and I think you guys might benefit from it too. I discovered this completely on accident I wasn't actively seeking out a solution so I have no proof that it works other than my story and a few other stories from the internet but let's be real, with endo some days it feels like you'd try literally anything to stop the pain. \nSo here goes...\nI went vegan about a year ago for unrelated reasons. About two months in I felt the discomfort in my abdomen that I have come to dread- the discomfort that was warning me that all bloody hell was about to break loose and that I'd be bed ridden for days. Luckily, it was a weekend so I had two days off work already and I preemptively called in sick for Monday; my boss was used to this and very accommodating. Then I bunkered down with my sleeping pills, heating pad and a stack of movies you sleep through. Then I waited.... and waited. The pre-period discomfort was never replaced by that feeling of being scraped out like a jack-o-lantern that I am way too familiar with.\n I was sure it was just a fluke. The thought that I would be rid of the nightmare just seemed too good to be true but the next month came and there was no pain. Just discomfort. After a few months I realized that the timing correlated to when I gave up dairy. I was already vegetarian so giving up meat didn't change anything. Dairy, though seemed to make all the difference. Upon doing some research, I found a ton of anecdotal evidence that giving up food high in estrogen- like dairy- can save a lot of pain.\nNow, I know what you're thinking 'I can't give up cheese, ice cream, butter etc.' But you don't need to give anything up, just substitute out foods high in estrogen. Instead of cows milk, try almond or rice milk. Eat cashew coconut or almond milk ice cream instead of dairy ice cream. Use smart balance butter instead of dairy butter. Try daiya (yuck) or follow your heart brand cheese. \nIt just takes two periods worth of dairy free dieting.

I\u2019ve had countless blood, urine, stool samples tested, as well as an outer and inner ultrasound and an endoscopy. \nWith one ultrasound they said they saw weird bloodflow close to my stomach/bowel, and referred me to an ischemia specialist.

{"id": "Endo_9lys5n", "text": "I'm 37 yo and have been dealing with a likely endometrioma or hemorrhagic cyst in my right ovary for a year. The cyst was an incidental finding on hip MRI after I tore my hip labrum in summer 2017. \n\nI saw my gyn in December 2017, transvaginal ultrasound found a 5 cm cyst on my right ovary. She strongly felt it was either an endometrioma or hemorrhagic cyst. I've never been on hormonal contraception, and so she was very suspicious of endometrioma. She discussed risk of torsion and suggested I consider surgical removal. I was stunned and freaked out and asked if we could watch and see. She agreed. Only 3 weeks later, I suddenly developed excruciating lower abdominal pain. I thought my insides were exploding and it hurt to even try to go pee. I lay in the fetal position for several hours, took a lot of pain meds and it finally resolved the next day. At the time, I was so na\u00efve and honestly had no clue what it was. Thinking back now, I think the cyst had burst.\n\nFast forward to February 2018: my US showed cyst was 4 cm, yay!  We were happy because it looked like the same cyst had shrank. She told me no surgery and come back in 6 months. Well, 8 months later, now I have a 7.8 cm cyst. The gyn strongly pushed surgical removal within the next few months. She said that she would begin the case laparoscopic, but if the cyst is too big and complicated, she would make a small open incision and there is a chance she may not be able to save that ovary. She said I shouldn't worry about having just 1 ovary, that most women do fine with just 1, and many are only born with one and have no problem. She is very confident it is not cancer, but that the fact it doubled in size was concerning and she worries about torsion or other medical emergency. She said that we could try hormonal contraception after surgery to try to prevent further cysts from forming, but taking the pill now would likely do nothing for the existing cyst. \n\nMy heart sank as she talked, but what she said seemed to make sense. I really need hip surgery, but this seems way more pressing. I told her I would go ahead with this surgery first and fix the torn hip labrum later. I haven't scheduled it yet, but now that I've had 24h to process it all, I've done nothing but obsess. I read online about unilateral oophorectomy and long term risk of dementia, cognitive decline, and cardiovascular disease. I keep going back and forth: maybe I should leave it alone and the cyst will shrink again. But what if it gets bigger - then the chances of her needing to remove the ovary seem much higher. \n\nI'm not getting any younger and I'm not even sure I want kids, but the sheer thought of having an ovary removed because of this one cyst is panicking me. Now I'm wondering if she's being overly aggressive. I never really thought I had symptoms except for that one severely painful day last December. I do occasionally feel abdominal bloating, but I thought it was because I have a big appetite and could stand to lose at least 10 pounds (lol). \n\nI plan to ask more questions when they call to schedule the case, but I wanted to ask you ladies if you can share any similar experiencea? Has anyone had unilateral oophorectomy because of a large endometrioma? What was healing time, how long were you off work, how have you done post-op, any recurrence of cysts?  Did your doctor talk about long term risks of removing the ovary? \n\nTL:DR = I'm panicked about surgical removal of a 8 cm possible endometrioma, gyn said she may not be able to save the ovary and I'm afraid of long term consequences of having only one ovary.

The pain kept all these months and although I knew something was wrong, I was always postponing an appointment. to get January I finally managed to get an appointment with my doctor, and she asked for another ultrasound which I just did yesterday.\n\nDuring the ultrasound, the lady started asking if I have painful periods, mostly in the first days, which I said yes. And then out of the blue, she proceeded to ask me if I ever was diagnosed with endometriosis and kept looking at the screen. I should have asked why she was asking but kept quiet. So by the end of it, she only mentioned that I now have a cyst on my left ovary and that my other cyst is gone. Now the ultrasound report will only be available by Wednesday and I feel like an idiot because I should have asked her if she was seeing something.\n\nMy mom had surgery when I was a kid and had her ovaries removed. Only after I told her about my first cyst (that I know of) she told me that it was endometriosis.

What if I do have it but the ultrasound doesn't detect it? Is it even possible?

I put searching for the reason why on hold, wanting to see if I can manage my tiredness myself... Then this happened. \n\nRoughly two to three weeks ago, I started to become aware that after peeing, there was a painful pulling sensation in my kidney area, worse in the left one than the right. I ignored it. I know, I'm stupid for doing so, but I've had weird painful sensations whilst peeing with endometriosis so I just assigned this new pain to my endo issues. The problem is, this has got worse and worse. I'm now at the point where I've had an x-ray (nothing on that), an ultrasound (they were checking for kidney stones but nothing there either), and the pain is much worse. Being active triggers it, just like my endo is triggered by activity. \n\nThe doctor is still keeping a concerned eye on me, because I'm still in pain, I've felt feverish, and I'm still passing blood in my urine.

From when I was about 15 or 16, I would get these debilitating cramps that left me doubled over, but my parents and I were so confused about them because they weren't associated with when I was on my period. Turns out, those were ovulation cramps and I still get them badly, along with menstrual cramps. My cycle is pretty irregular now. My longest period ever was last fall and ended up being 24 days straight of heavy bleeding. Mostly I average 7-9, but often still get two periods in a month or skip for a while. I also experience heavy bleeding, a very strong \u201ctugging\" feeling on left ovary especially when walking/moving left leg accompanied by a searing, stabbing feeling if I stretch out my abdomen/torso (arms above head) while I have this, fatigue especially while on my period, ovarian cysts, stabbing pain deep in the vaginal canal that seems to be unassociated with menstruation, bloating, sometimes painful urination and bowel movements on or before my period, \u201cmittelschmerz,\" and iron-deficient anemia (due to the bleeding). I think I'm missing some symptoms but those are the big ones. Due to other health concerns I cannot take NSAIDs/painkillers, so curling up on the ground with a heating pad or hot water bottle is not unusual.\n\nI have seen two different OBGYNs so far, the first of which was useless and misread test results, telling me I probably had a brain tumor when there was no indication of that. I switched practices and had my first appointment there this past August, where the practitioner told me I show all the signs of endometriosis. Going in, I was guessing PCOS because of the cysts I get (and that run in the family), and Endo wasn't even on my radar, but she said that PCOS was unlikely while endo was the most likely cause. I have a number of other health conditions, so I can't take regular birth control. Doctor wanted me to try the arm BC, Nexplanon, but after hearing horrible side effect stories from others I opted out. I am about 7 weeks into a strict gluten, dairy, soy, caffeine, alcohol- free regimen and although i'm sure i'll slip up here and there, plan to maintain it longterm if I absolutely have to. \n\nI guess my question is, does this sound like Endo to you, and if so what is my next step? Down the road I'm not opposed to the surgery but would be **so** terrified that they wouldn't find anything and that they'd think it was all in my head. That actually scares me already, since my primary care and other doctors have justified it as \"bad periods.\" None of my friends experience anything like this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/9p9lhv/does_this_sound_like_endo_to_you/"}

{"id": "Endo_9f116o", "text": "Thanks ahead of time for anyone willing to read this, I really appreciate it.  I hope nothing I say comes off as insensitive since I know endo is no walk in the park and I commend everyone here for dealing with it!\n\nI'm 30 and got off the birth control pill a few months ago to get pregnant (on Cycle 4 now).  I got my first period at 11 and have always had uneventful, regular and pretty much pain-free periods.  My main concern re: endo is that I'm not pregnant yet despite perfect timing, and that endo might be the reason, but I also tend to be dramatic so I want to make sure I'm not jumping the gun here.  Can you let me know if you think endo is worth bringing up with my doctor based on this?  \n\nSince going off the pill I have been ovulating regularly, but cycles have been on the long side (30 days, 58 days, 37 days, so far), with a long follicular phase and short luteal phase (I know with endo the cycles tend to be shorter, no?)  Periods have actually been on the light side, with some light (very bearable) cramping only on day 1, and then flow getting progressively lighter after that.  This is similar to how my periods were before the pill.  I have NEVER had menstrual pain bad enough to warrant a painkiller or staying home.\n\nSo, I would think endo was not likely for me, except...\n\nI have ovulation pain. It's never unbearable, but it's much worse than my super mild period cramps.  It basically feels like when you're running after drinking a glass of water and your abdomen cramps up, except on one side (stitch area).  It's always been on my right side for some reason, all three months.  It also tends to make my entire ovary area more sensitive, so deep penetration during sex might hurt a little (not bad enough to prevent me from having sex though).  On the third month, the ovulation pain radiated to my back and side, but only for about 2 hours.  It's like this deep, dull ache that radiates if I take a step, jump, or do anything to jostle my insides. Basically, during this time, any activity that jostles my insides near my pelvic area will feel a slight twinge of pain, so that includes using the bathroom.  This subsides after I finish ovulating and then I don't feel any pain at all.\n\nI used to have issues with gas, constipation and bloating as a teen and in my early 20s but that subsided.  My doctor thinks it was related to anxiety that I had, and a general family trait, because almost everyone in my family has IBS to some degree, including the men (especially the anxious men).  Now my digestive system is very regular and comfortable and I assume with endo it would get worse over time, but I'm not sure (any help here is great.)\n\nThere's no endo in my family, but I know that's not necessary to have it.\n\nMy concern is that because I don't have many symptoms, I don't want to wind up going through a lot of costly procedures only to find out I've been playing Dr. Google all this time.  What would be the best course of action here?  If there's some way to semi-accurately rule it out, without surgery, that would obviously be great.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/9f116o/i_have_ovulation_pain_but_no_period_pain_is_this/"}

It was sharp and built up in frequency and intensity from August to February. I ended up in emergency and was referred to a gyno who discussed endo with me. I fit all the symptoms: constant pelvic pain, ovarian cysts (another one has developed since August), irregular periods, painful periods, pain during sex, family history and more. Since I have been on hormonal birth control for about 5 years we scheduled a laparoscopy to confirm. \n\nMy laparoscopy was two days ago. I awoke and was told by nurses that everything looked great! He saw no Endo and I\u2019m healthy. While my gyno/surgeon was not there, he left me a note saying that he has changed his diagnosis of endo to primary dysmenorrhea and that we will discuss treatment later in May. If you don\u2019t know, primary dysmenorrhea is essentially painful period cramps. Secondary dysmenorrhea is painful period cramps caused y endo, but this was not his diagnosis. \n\nI ended up just bawling my eyes out in post op because after being in constant pain for eight months, I\u2019m back at square one with \u201cpainful period cramps\u201d.

I set up an intermittent leave of absence for work, as I had a lot of bad days and the policy at X Hospital is no more than 3 unscheduled absence occurrences in a 6 month period. I went well over that, due to debilitating pain from my Endo. Fast forward to 4 months ago; I had surgery and I was diagnosed with Stage IV. When I returned to work, I was hounded by my manager because my surgeon had not submitted the necessary paperwork. She started threatening me with disciplinary action and potential termination. It was also around this time that the HR rep who had been handling my case and my intermittent LOA was suddenly no longer employed. For whatever sketchy reason, my intermittent LOA was discontinued, and no one could tell me why. On top of this all, my surgeon was not a NOOK specialist, and wound up not getting all the Endo she could see, and so I was in excruciating pain pretty frequently again. My manager became even more persistent with threats about disciplinary action (which would go on my record for any time I try to apply for another hospital job). We managed to get the paperwork for my surgery squared away, and they gave me a \u201cwarning\u201d for missing so many days. Despite my saying that I had once had an intermittent LOA and I want to know where the hell it went. This leads up to today. My manager has sent me an email and a text message asking for dates and times that we can meet AGAIN (5th time in a 1 month period). Now I know the next step of the \u201cmeeting\u201d is disciplinary action, which is something I don\u2019t want to have o my record.

I am seeing a functional health doctor that I like a lot, Dr. Jones-Bailey in Atlanta, who did a billion blood tests and gave me a crapload of supplements, but she noticed I was feeling super overwhelmed and sad, so she spoke with my therapist and they and I decided a good course of action would be to do a limited course of antidepressants to get me through my last year of school and then the beginning of job searching and all that stressful jazz. The doc went ahead and prescribed some for me since it would take a few weeks before I can see a psychiatrist, which I will hopefully be able to schedule soon.\n\n\nShe prescribed Welbutrin but my insurance didn't cover it so I went ahead and got the generic brand Bupropion.

A little backstory: I'm 22 years old, my excruciating periods started when I was 12. I was diagnosed with endometriosis with my first lap surgery in Feb 2014 when I was 18. I had a second surgery in Sept 2015 with my now current doctor. I've been on Lupron a few times (and will never do it again), and I had an IUD inserted two and a half years ago as treatment (I stopped being able to feel strings after a few months with the IUD, every appointment and ultrasound I had after that, I made sure to have them check that it was still in place, with no issue). From about Jan 2016 to Dec 2016, I was on the Marina IUD with Norothindrone (aka \"add back\" for Lupron - not quite a birth control, but still a hormone medication). In January of 2017, I had an insurance change and I could no longer afford to be on Norothindrone. \n\nFor the past five months, I have been going through what I can only describe as permanent PMS. I am cramping every day (on top of the sharp endo pains). I have spontaneous bleeding. My hair is falling out. My boobs hurt. I'm hungry all the time. I cry over any and everything. I'm breaking out consistently. These are all symptoms I experienced before having a period, way back when I had a somewhat normal cycle. I haven't had a normal cycle since I was 18 and diagnosed, just breakthrough bleeding with hormone treatments. \n\nWell, I decided that I wanted the IUD removed, since my body isn't responding to it well by itself and I can't afford the add-back. My OGBYN is an hour and a half away, but my primary care doc is 10 minutes away. I scheduled the seemingly simple procedure with my primary car doc. Because of my high premium/high deductible insurance plan, I researched what this easy, every day procedure would cost. I went in to the appointment.

I can't afford a specialty doctor visit right now. I don't know if my depression and acne and excruciating pain is because of the IUD, or lack of IUD. And I am so frustrated that my body can't even do this right. I am switching insurance companies again as of July 1st, and I hope to whatever god is out there that I can afford to see a doctor, because this current insurance plan has screwed me out of visits and procedures and medications. I am so angry at my body and I can't help but hate myself because of this. My hormones can't function properly and my uterus can't hold an IUD right and I can't go a day without pain and I just don't know what to do anymore.

{"id": "Endo_773m90", "text": "(Backstory) I was surgically diagnosed with endo a few years back. After a few false starts, I found that Mirena worked well for my symptoms and didn't aggravate any of my other medical conditions. I had mine inserted about a year and a half ago. My normal endo doctor said that the Mirena may not last the full 5 years for endo treatment (but would still work for birth control) and if I got symptoms again I could just switch it out and get a new one. \n\nA few months ago, I started getting symptoms again. It started as not too bad but quickly escalated. When I called the clinic I work with, I learned my normal doctor is out on leave and was scheduled with someone new. \n\nThe new doctor told me that replacing the Mirena wouldn't do anything, told me that my first choice would be to consider Lupron and that if that doesn't work a full hysterectomy would be strongly considered. \n\nThis... feels wrong. \n\nI don't know much about Lupron, but after looking at the website she gave me I know I can't do it. I have too many conflicting diseases that I'm not willing to destabilize for temporary relief. \n\nI am not opposed to a hysterectomy, but have heard that it's not actually a treatment for endo. I wouldn't miss my fertility, but I'm a bit young for menopause, and would only want to undertake such a large procedure if it had a high success rate. \n\nI'm also a bit confused as to why the doctor that has known me for years suggested a new Mirena at the point this one fails (as if she knew it wouldn't last too much longer at my last appointment) but how that is not an option at all according to the new doctor. \n\nIt also seems a bit dramatic that I'm left with two choices before even having an ultrasound (scheduled soon) or getting the test results back about possible infection causing my symptoms. \n\nAm I out of line for thinking this is wrong? I'm a bit emotional after the appointment, so I can't tell if I'm not thinking straight or if this is actually just simply not right. \n\nAny advice/guidance/informative links/what have you would be very welcome right now.

{"id": "Endo_5vy7c8", "text": "Hi, I have a few questions about spotting I experience every month. I had an unofficial endo dx in 2015. I had to have an ectopic pregnancy/tube removed and the surgeon noted I have adhesions behind my uterus. In May of last year, I started having light bleeding every month about 4-5 days past ovulation. I test with OPKs, so I am certain of the bleeding in relation to O. The bleeding ranges from a few drops, to light bleeding over a few hours. One month, I passed a blood clot. \n\nI saw a RE last year for IF, where it was determined that IVF is our best route, which we've chosen not to do. I had a HSG last April that determined my my one tube is open and a SHG last month with my GYN to try and determine if the midcycle bleeding is caused by uterine fibroids. \n\nThe SHG turned up all clear of fibroids with a normal uterus, so I am thankful for that, but pretty frustrated right now. My GYN shrugged it off and attributed it to be O related, but I don't understand how spotting 4-5 days after O is something O related. I had blood work with the RE last year that determines my AMH levels and egg reserve is low, so he gave me a dx of POF. Right now the only conclusion I can come to is that perhaps this has to do with endo.\n\nI'm uncertain of where to go from here. I've consulted the map of endo specialists and there are none listed in my area. I don't know if this is even endo related or if I'm overreacting, but I find this new monthly spotting very concerning. I would just like some answers as to why it may be happening, and if it is somehow hurting my chances of getting pregnant naturally.

Also have had occasional pains during sex, mostly if my cervix is low and gets bumped, and only once had pain when it wouldn't have been my cervix (but felt like that general area). If I sit down too hard, like a big jolt, it'll hurt... Not sure if that's normal. \n\nBut this time was insane. I knew I was about to start my period in the next day or two, but I went for a half mile run anyway and realized I felt \"off\". It was about 90 degrees outside but I'd been running in worse heat the previous week and felt fine. I just don't run too far and mostly pay attention to my body if it seems stressed. I started to walk the half mile home.\n\nI was only a quarter mile from home when I started cramping. I tried to keep walking but it was apparent very quickly that if I didn't sit down I would faint, so I walked into the ditch and sat with my head between my knees. My belly was burning and my whole body was slick with sweat, I could hardly think and I remember thinking I might still pass out even sitting down but that would be nice. With great effort, I called my two roommates but neither answered. Right around that time, a lady pulled up and asked if I was ok. I said no and asked for a ride, barely managing to get in her car and tell her which house was mine. I vaguely remember telling her my name and saying I appreciated her before I walked into the house and collapsed on the floor. \n\nLong story short, I managed to get ahold of my roommate and get myself into a tub with a few inches of cold water. At first the water didn't feel cold, and around this time I was hit with rolling cramps that knocked the wind out of me. I couldn't speak, I wanted to pass out, I wanted to vomit. It felt like I was having contractions only 5 seconds apart. Eventually I started shivering and knew my body temp was low enough, so I switched to hot water. The heat eased the cramps gradually until they dissipated completely. It wasn't until they were gone that I felt fully present mentally. \n\nFrom start to finish this all lasted about 2 hours, and then I started bleeding. Welcome, my period, you have entered the world, are you happy now?\n\nI'm pretty sure I just had a vasovagal syncope reaction to the cramps themselves, since I've had several experiences of nausea, sweating, and fainting from other abdominal pain.

{"id": "Endo_5fk75r", "text": "I don't want to get in too in depth, but I have been having many concerns that are making me consider, in part Endo, but also other issues maybe fibroids or something--I just don't know. I have a lot of the classic symptoms - leg pain (thighs, lower back, hips, abdomen, etc) but doc doesn't think it's related to sciatica, and I get dull aches and pains not necessarily during, but often after sex (which doc thinks is just a result of me not orgasming all the time...?), heavy and irregular periods (doc is currently helping through trial and error of finding a birth control that might help with periods and pain), even had my doc thinking I had *maybe* slight PCOS a few months ago, but brushed that off because aside from some hursutism and some hair loss, my hormones are in the normal range, I don't have IBS (though I do have IBS symptoms--esp around my period), and my ultrasounds several months back show nothing and my insides are 'perfect' according to my doc. (Is it worth noting that until recently I've never had IBS symptoms??)\n\nSo here is where I am kind of conflicted--and I guess I partly know what advice you'll give--but please give it to me because I just don't know.\n\nToday i had my follow-up on whether the BC Lo Loestrin Fe was working...and in a previous post, I noted that in fact, my pain did not leave, and I had 2 periods each month! She did note that was not good and now I'm set to try Natazia.\n\nBut then in regards to all of my other issues--she basically said it was:\n\n1) Dull pain from sex probably because you're not always orgasming all the way (news to me...because even if I don't orgasm all the way, it's not like I don't feel pleasure...so idk how that works)\n\n2) Referred me to a chiropractor who she insists is \"not like the scary story chiropractors\" most people assume, because that will help my lower back/leg pain which she thinks is more due to me being misaligned\n\nAnd here's the thing--it's not that I'm fundamentally against chiropractors, but I have more than just aching back...I have legs that have shooting pain and go numb (she made me do a stretch and 'ruled out' anything to deal with my sciatica--although, I will note--she felt around with her hand my abdomen and near everything---and since, all my pain has just been flaring like crazy, though it's been pretty bad today from the beginning anyway). Anyway--I also have pangs, not just in lower back and legs and hips--but like actually near my pelvis and abdomen, similar in sensation to when I've had a cyst before)--so I just don't get how ALL of those issues (Whack periods for basically my whole life, pain in many areas, IBS symptoms, etc.) account into just being misaligned? I understand physical therapy would probably help (I don't really know how comfortable I am going to the particular chiropractor she recommended...), but that won't 'solve' the issue, will it? \n\nI just don't know what to do. My doc seems really fixated on my main issues being sex and back/hip pain--when I feel like, surely there's a larger picture here, right? \n\nI'm also just partially confused because most of these issues haven't really been a problem until much recently. Like sex--it has NEVER been an issue before, and only lately has it sometimes been uncomfortable. \n\nAnyway...what to do? Should I seek out another opinion? I also don't want to just assume endo myself, and only affirm-the-consequence, rather than really considering other options. I just...don't really know what other options there could be. \n\nI know some people have had success with endocrinologists and endo diagnosis. Is it worth consulting an endocrinologist? I'm just worried since they're coming from and endocrin-angle, that the fact that my hormones seem to be fine won't be as telling. Or maybe there's more they can do? Should I just see a specialist? On the sidebar map, the closest specialist is about an hour away. I realize that's fairly close considering not a lot are as lucky. Again--I don't want to just 'affirm the consequence' and it's not like I *want* to walk toward a laprascopy or anything. \n\nAdvice? Should I seek a new doc? Maybe see an endocrinologist *and* a endometriosis specialist? What is a consult like with an endo specialist?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/5fk75r/what_to_do_about_doc_help/"}

The packages only contain 21 tablets)\n\nLast month I had a checkup appointment with my doctor. He did an ultrasound and said that the endometrial tissue in my uterus was still way too much.

I'd appreciate any input! \n\nSecond issue! My gyno wants to put me on Lupron. This really REALLY scares me because of the horror stories I've heard about this drug. I also suffer from pretty severe anxiety (I'm on celexa for this) and I've read that lupron can cause severe anxiety as well. It took me a good two years to get my anxiety back under control and if there is even .0001% of a chance lupron could bring it back I don't want this drug near me. Am I being over-reactionary or am I in the right to be extremely cautious when discussing even thinking about starting this medication? again, any input is greatly appreciated! \n\n\nSorry for a bit of a long post, I would just like some advice from someone other than my gyno and my mother who knows just about as much as me (very little lol)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/4xrsrf/finally_got_some_answers_but_now_i_have_some_new/"}

{"id": "Endo_4vpey3", "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nit's a relief and also terrifying to find this community and read all these posts. It also makes me so mad. I didn't know about Endometriosis until a few months ago. I'm 27 fucking years old and think I've had it since I was young, with no one ever considering that the pain I was in wasn't normal. \n\nSince I was 13 my periods were terrible. The first few days of every month I had chills, diarrhea, vomiting, cramps that kept me on the floor, I couldn't sleep because of the pain. I'd cry and cry because it hurt so bad. The muscles in my legs and thighs would cramp, my hands would shake. Everyone, including my mom, said \"periods hurt, this is how it is, take some Midol\" \n\nI just dealt with it until I eventually went on ocp's and my periods got better, lighter.  It's amazing how you can sort of forget pain like that. \nAnyways, I switched from ocp's to a Mirena IUD about 5 months ago (health benefits! yay!) \nLeading up to the insertion I did notice some cramps in between my periods but I was also dealing with having a parasite in my intestine (gross sorry) so I thought the cramps were because of that. \nbut, a month after the IUD was implanted, I had an ovarian cyst rupture. I didn't know what was happening. The pain was bad enough to force me to crouch into a ball on the floor at work. I was pale, shaky, dizzy. I almost vomited a few times. I had never experienced shock before, I think that's what it was. I've always considered myself healthy, and I hate going to the mediclinic (have experienced some truly incompetent doctors) so I just went home and ate some painkillers and fell asleep. My sister came home early from work and kept an eye on me. I felt fine later.\n I was worried my IUD was expelling itself. So my obgyn scheduled an ultrasound to check, and they found the cyst. It was 4cm in diameter on my right ovary (not that big, but man that seems big to me). \nMy obgyn was pretty dismissive of it, or maybe that's just her attitude (she's very efficient).  She said my ultrasound looked normal and that was that. \nBut for the next month, I had intense pain for 28 out of 30 days. I went back to her and told her, and she said \"let's see if you're still in pain in another month\" \nIs this normal? That I should just wait and have pain nearly every day? \nover the last few months I have spotting and pain when I sit or lean forward, pain in my thighs, nausea, stinging cramps on my right side. Maybe another one is growing?  It's bad enough to make me cry once in a while, especially the last few days. \n\"Wait and take advil\" doesn't seem good enough. She never mentioned endometriosis, or any other condition. She didn't seem concerned at all, even the ultrasound tech said \"ovarian cysts are super common, they're not a big deal\"\n Oh I also asked my obgyn if maybe the IUD was a factor in this, and she said, really short, \"well do you want me to take it OUT?\" \nI didn't go back to her even though the pain didn't stop (though it got a little better)... I thought she was quite dismissive of me (she's one of the doctors on the map on here too - someone must have had an ok experience I guess).\n  I was almost crying when I told her about the pain and she seem impatient to get on with the next patient. Sigh. \n\nAnyways, I'm going to see my GP tomorrow and I want to ask about endometriosis. That cyst could have been an endometrioma? I don't know. \nDoes anyone have advice for how to advocate for yourself when you're super shy and anxious around doctors? DO IUD's have anything to do with Ovarian cysts? Or Endometriosis? I feel like a hypochondriac. I've been googling things and trying to get an understanding of what's happening. \n\nAny advice or help would be so appreciated.

They found two patches of endo (one of which was behind my uterus), and I was diagnosed with stage 1 (minimal) endometriosis. My symptoms were severe pain with periods and pain with penetration (I was unable to have PIV sex at all). (My family is convinced that since it was only stage 1 that couldn't have been what was causing the pain and it must've been in my head...sigh). My periods were also quite heavy so I had a D+C as well. The pain was greatly lessened after surgery, although I still had issues with heavy periods and some pain. Luckily I have been able to have penetrative sex, and the cramps were lessened. After a few failed stints of various configurations of birth control pills (continuous birth control gave me awful, constant breakthrough bleeding), I got a Mirena IUD 2 years ago, and haven't had a real period since, except for a little bit of spotting for the first few months. It's been glorious.\n\nHowever, lately, I've found I've had some random intermittent pelvic pain. It's not at all severe, but it happens sometimes.

I'm in a relationship with a cis man and I seem to feel a really strong, sharp pain in certain positions, I guess if he's penetrating me too deeply.\n\nCould this be a sign of my endo coming back?

We tried the mini pill for a few months, did another ultrasound, found nothing has changed, then scheduled surgery.\nThe surgery went off without a hitch, I felt great within a few days.\nThe surgeon said the mass was double the size than that on the imaging, it was under my uterus and I also had growths on the other ovary and bowels. He said it was \"mangled\" in there. My left ovary was completely covered and Fallopian tube twisted. My ovary was saved and the mass removed, but the part on my bowels stayed...he didn't feel it was necessary to remove it. He didn't tell me much after that and I was too loopy to ask any questions. They then sent me for a depo provera shot 5 days later.\n\nMy question is, is this a good plan to keep it under control?

After taking pain pills for around 10 days to cover the surgery pain I would guess I have taken less than ten pain killers in the past several months, which is absolutely awesome as before I was taking 6-8 paracetamol and codeine pills along with 2400mg ibuprofen to take the edge off.\n\nThe only downside is I really feel that hormonal treatment's don't really agree with me emotionally. I haven't been feeling great lately which while I don't think is due to the hormones, they really just make the situation worse. My libido has severely diminished. When by myself it is non existent but thankfully partner can still arouse me but I do need to get over the mental hurdle that just goes \"ugh, effort!\". I'm really close to quitting a martial art I took up last year as I just can't keep up with the classes and one of the senior member's hassles me alot when I'm sitting out  just watching as I'm too sore to participate. This guy knows I have a medical issue. At this point it was just getting to me so much that I'm taking a break from it initially for a few weeks, but possible for longer.\n\nI decided to go see a physio last week to see if he thought the pain (right hip pain) was a sport's injury or if he thought it might be something else. I was really happy when I found out he knew what endo was and how what I was feeling sounded like adhesions. So I have a bunch of gentle stretches to do 2/3 times and another appointment to see him again in 2 weeks. He seems confident that I will respond well to treatment which I was happy to hear.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on dealing with the mental/emotional effects of the hormones?
