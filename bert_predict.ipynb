              " \"I'm a 20yo female (rather obviously) and have been having terrible abdominal pain since I was 16 - before this they thought it was just ovarian cysts causing pain (until the cysts were gone and the pain didn't stop). Two weeks ago I got laparoscopic surgery to diagnose and cauterize Endo. During the surgery they perforated my bowel and had to bring in another surgeon to repair it. I woke up 3 hours later than planned with a 3inch incision rather than a 1cm incision. They found the tissue related to Endometriosis but couldn't cauterize much due to the complication. I had to stay in hospital for 3 days and when they released me I had a large lump under my incision which they told me was inflammation and it would go down. After a few days I started getting terrible fevers and stinging in my incision, the lump was causing me a lot of pain. I went to my gynecologist and she said she thought it MAY be an infection so she put me on Cipro and Metronidazole for a week. The fevers didn't go away nor did the stinging and pain. I went to see the surgeon who did the bowel repair yesterday and he immediately sent me to the ER. They ended up doing surgery using a local anesthetic (so I was wide awake) and they cut out the lump (which was filled with bloodclots and cloudy fluid which was apparently what was causing the infection). Now I have a hole (open wound) in my abdomen that has been packed and home care has to come see me everyday to change the packing. \",\n",
              " \"My gynecologist hasn't mentioned too much about treatment for the endo until I have fully recovered but I'm under the impression she wants me on Lupron. I'm almost ready to just say give me a hysterectomy and lets be done with all this... \\nI'm trying to get through University and this is causing me A LOT of money and REALLY holding me back from my studies. Not only the recovery and endo symptoms but even being on Dilaudid, Tramadol and Celebrex is hard on my body and my mind.\",\n",
              " \"I have tried 6 families of birth control and they all make me extremely sick and I'm very sensitive to medication. I was wondering if it's advisable to skip the medicinal treatments and get the hysterectomy right away.\",\n",

I felt like he was berating me when I repeated why I couldn't take it and he simply said he wasn't asking me to take it for long like I was a silly little girl who didn't know what was good for me.\",\n",

But I’ve not had a lap to confirm and the most of the symptoms don’t match so just wanted to check what you might think of this? Doctors never showed too much interest, they always want to put me on birth control or nsaids, but we are TTC now. ',\n",

I had it done and whaddaya know, nothing came up.

It mainly comprises of sharp pains radiating from my sides and lower abdomen/back. The closest thing I can describe it as is electric currents that run through my body and leave me breathless. Aside from that, I get the bloating, cramping, soreness, tenderness, etc. Every doctor that I've described my pain to/has seen me in pain has compared it to active labor contractions. I've had doctors also think that I may have IBS too. Doctors never categorized my pain as endometriosis because I don't fit the traditional mold of what it looks like (they just said it was PMDD instead because I also have anxiety and depression), but my new gynecologist says that she's seen plenty of women who have endometriosis with their symptoms more pain-related. I've gotten used to the pain, but I don't think I can live like this much longer.
