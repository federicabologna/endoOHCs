['Definitely, I usually vomit 3-4 times a day on a "good" period, the worse I had was 15(!!) Times a day even if I don\'t eat anything at all..the thing that helps me the most is cannabis, it reduces the amount of times I vomit and really helps with nausea! (And of course help with the pain)']
['I have SIBO and find that fennel capsules and enteric coated peppermint capsules really help with my bloating. They‚Äôre both pretty mild supplements, but definitely check with your doctor before starting- fennel is a diuretic so you might need to be careful post-surgery.']
["I also have trouble with Miralax - it can make me really bloated but nothing comes out. I found that taking it with some electrolyte solution (Gatorade, Pedialyte, etc.) helps. I've had to use Golytely (by prescription) and it really cleared me out - it's basically miralax with tons of electrolytes."]
['I‚Äôve had a lot of gastrointestinal symptoms, and I find two teas help: turmeric ginger (anti-inflammatory) plus peppermint (good for gas/bloating). Plus the hydration helps keep things moving!']
["I have near constant nausea, but I think it's caused by having generalized anxiety. I know it sucks a lot. I can only suggest what I do when my nausea is bad: I keep white bread on hand (the only food I can stomach usually) and put a little bit of honey on it so that I have something in my stomach, usually that helps my nausea just a bit. Drinking peppermint or ginger tea also helps a bit!  "]
["My Dr prescribed stool softeners and I still didn't go until about 5 days after surgery, the pain meds really stop everything up, so foods that are easy to digest are great (I ate a lot of applesauce, soup, melon type fruit, saltines)."]
['This list above, plus stool softeners, ginger ‚Äúbeer‚Äù (a stronger ginger soda than ginger ale, works wonders for nausea!) and jello (easy to eat when you need something with your pain pills). ']
['For the nausea. Bland food always, cracker even bananas. Ginger tea, ginger soda, ginger candies etc. \nplain broths or even grits have been something that helps for me']
['Also, try ginger ‚Äúbeer‚Äù - it‚Äôs like a really strong ginger ale soda. You can find it in most liquor stores with the mixers and such - little sips of that stuff is really great for nausea and I think better than water or sprite. ']
["Hi. If you're on NSAIDS you should also be on a proton pump inhibitaor to help protect your stomach lining. These are things like Nexium or Romep in the EU. I can pretty highly recomnend supository pain meds to avoid stomach issues. They also work faster than oral meds."]


["I'm definitely going to get a bunch of easy foods to snack on - especially things high in fibre to help with that dreaded post op poop. "]
["I also burp constantly, but I've never tried to stop it. Sometimes I actually try to encourage it, as I sometimes get trapped gas in my stomach and it hurts."]
['- perscription proton pump inhibitor (like antacid)\n- iberogast (bitter drops/herbal supplement)\n- simethicone (for bloating but helped a lot)\n- domperidon mepha (anti nausea med)\n- ginger and peppermint tea (drink all day every day, helps a ton)']
['I cans we a warm, soothing drink would make you feel better. Weirdly, English breakfast tea is the one beverage I can drink no matter how ill I feel, and I don‚Äôt even like tea usually! It seems to settle nausea a bit.']
["Miralax is an osmotic laxative, it's a powder that you can add to a drink or water, it helps keep water in the stool to help the stool pass more easily. Constipation can exacerbate bloating, so if she's constipated then relieving that may relieve some of the bloating as well. "]
['I love ginger ale or Sprite. Sodas like that help me burp and it relieves some nausea and gas pains. If I have no appetite I honestly just don‚Äôt eat, because it can make me even more sick if I force myself. I suggest light snacks like crackers, goldfish crackers, applesauce, soup, or other small and light things that you‚Äôd normally eat when you‚Äôre sick with the flu tbh üòÖ']
["Nausea is the worst! Lately I've been nauseous 1-3 days a week, and honestly, ginger is my savior. I've been keeping ginger candies with me for random nausea, and  I found some ginger-flavored CBD mints in a local dispensary (I'm in California) that really help me. Ginger and lemon tea also help when I have time to make it (either with fresh ginger and lemon, or with a tea bag). I've also found that peppermint tea helps too. I try to eat bland foods (oatmeal, crackers, plain bread, etc) on days that I'm really nauseous. Staying hydrated in general also helps."]
['I recommend eating liquids the first day or two and then increasing to solids, as you may not have a bowel movement for a few days due to the medication. I‚Äôve been eating comfort soups and jello and it‚Äôs been great. Drink lots of water and have some tea nearby too. Sometimes the breathing tube can irritate your throat and I‚Äôve found that popsicles and tea are helping it! ']
["D-mannose is mostly used for UTI prevention as it keeps bacteria from adhering to the urinary tract. I wouldn't recommend it other than as needed but it seems to help with the spasms by making the urine less caustic and easier to completely eliminate. "]
['For gas, prunes help. I take probiotics. Yoghurt. Chamomile tea. Walking around, strangely also seems to help me.']


['Zofran is super fast reacting &amp; has helped me a ton! I suffer from chronic nausea &amp; it has been the only thing to consistently help me. ']
['Prep easy simple foods for your first few days. And eat simple foods prior to surgery too. It will help with the constipation.']
["Be sure to use a bulk laxative like metamucil or Miralax or a stool softener like colace. You don't want stimulant laxatives after surgery."]
['Yes! Cavities and gum problems forever‚Ä¶But also, I know there is a correlation between low vitamin d and teeth problems so maybe check that out?']
['Daily Magnesium &amp; potassium supplement helps my digestion a lot. Fiber usually makes things worse for me.']
['The throat issues get better in a few days and are normal. Try lozenges and sip water. Throat sprays can help too. ']
["The round ones are actually once a week. Vitamin D, omega 3, quercetin, berberine, Alpha lipoic acid, vitamin C, zinc, chelated iron, selenium, chelated magnesium.\nAt night there's also a packet of probiotics."]
["I've had issues with chronic constipation myself. I found Fibercon bulk forming laxative twice a day keeps me regular. It also doesnt ferment in your gut causing painful gas like metamucil pills did (for me at least) "]
['For the diarrhea I always keep loperamide (Imodium) at home, which seems to ease the diarrhea and frequency. Drink plenty of fluids, and if you experience it mainly in the morning, try eating toast or bananas for breakfast.']
['See if you can get a prescription for Zofram - it‚Äôs an anti-nausea med that‚Äôs helped me! Ginger tea, turmeric, peppermint tea, all help me when I feel nauseas. Smoothies are great for days when I can‚Äôt eat anything and need nutrients.']




Topic 1 Lap prep and post-op
lap excision weeks first back still time two months post one surgeon ago recovery week removed last hysterectomy much years done ablation better took second

['Minimum 2 of not working at all, 3 weeks if you can work from home for the last week. I was out a full month for my last one and I‚Äôm stage 4 and I had bowel, bladder, ligaments, and everything else you can think of and I originally said 3 weeks but got an infection. Without the infection I think I could‚Äôve gone back in 3 if I took it lightly.']
["My body also tends to heal really slowly, so I'm hoping my bowel issues will improve over the next few months. My friend who had a c-section told me that it takes time for your bowel to re-settle since it's been moved around a lot during your surgery. On top of that, things were cut off &amp; sutured...so I'm not surprised they need a little more time to heal!"]
['As far as recovery, I found both of mine to be pretty similar. A lot just depends on what all they do when they are in there, if she finds she has to remove a lot of legions and tissue then you might find it takes a bit longer to recover. On my second my doctor told me he was more aggressive with removal, but overall the recovery seemed about the same still. ']
["It honestly depends, I went to a well known endo excision surgeon who removed stage 3 along with a bladder resection. Had to have another surgery 11 months later. It's been 5 months after my second lap and so far so good. It mostly depends on stage, location of lesions and the technique the dr has used to remove endo"]
['I had my lap 4 weeks ago (21 June). The surgeon found significant and more endo stuck to a fibroid. He had to shave back a bit of my bowel and put tubes in my ureters during surgery (which were then removed). Fortunately, he was able to excise everything that he found. I have been off work recovering, and it has been going well overall.']
['Lap 1 - pain relief but pain came back in a year\nLap 2 - only a little relief, but far more painful, but surgery burned growths as opposed to cutting out growths.\nLap 3 - a little pain relief, but still in pain\nLap 4 - no growth found, but "released scar tissue" and there was a lot of pain relief']
["I'm super new here, have my first ever surgery on April 18. Is bowel prep normal for pre-surgery? My doc is doing a diagnostic lap, as well as removing my tubes. Bowel prep might just make this whole thing worse. I'm already panicking a bit (a lot). "]
['Well my surgery is 7/12 and I was going to take 6 days off including the weekend and go back 7/18. I got told can‚Äôt you come back that Monday it‚Äôs not an invasive surgery. I was like. I don‚Äôt know what my body will do/act/how I will feel. So no I‚Äôm coming back on the 18 and they were like what about the 17 and I was like no. The 18. And they were like but it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre removing organs. It‚Äôs just tissue it‚Äôs like getting a cut you‚Äôll be fine. ']
['They told me about an hour, I never asked how long it took after but the most would have been an hour and a half, I had a few things done at the same time so that probably added some time on. If there is really extensive endo then maybe it would take a little longer for the dr to excise it all but if it‚Äôs a specialist it‚Äôs usually pretty fast.']
['Hi! I had my first lap in 2014 or 2015 (can‚Äôt remember) and I was only really out of commission for a few days. They told me about a week recovery which was right. With that being said, I had robotic excision surgery a week ago and I‚Äôm still recovering. I think it all just depends on how your body handles the procedure. ']


["2. Pain is to be expected because, even though the surgery is minimally invasive and outpatient, it's still surgery and your body will take time to recover. I'm not sure if you had excision or ablation, but recovery from excision takes anywhere from 6 months to a year! So I wouldn't be surprised if your pain isn't completely gone, your body takes a while to heal."]
['I had surgery about three months ago, and I felt relief right away, but I only had minimal adhesions and one of my tubes was being pulled on, so having that separated helped a lot with my day-to-day pain. My mom had her first surgery with the same doctor about a month ago and he found tons of endo and her recovery has been a lot slower than mine. ']
['Why are you going back to work on Monday? Minimum recovery time for explotatory lap is 1 week for return to work with 6-8 weeks for full recovery. My last lap I took 3 weeks to start to feel better as they had to do a lot internally even tho I had 3 teeny incisions.']
["I've had two laps -- one last April, and one last October. The first lap left me with a 3 cm scar and a 1 cm scar. The second re-used the 1 cm incision, and then gave me two more 1 cm scars. They have all faded a bunch, even the ones from October, and that wasn't even a year ago. The big scar I had from my first surgery is barely noticeable at all now -- I actually struggled to find the ends to measure it just now."]
['I had my surgery about 11 years ago? I had an incision in my belly button and pubic area, I was a little sore, achy. Had the surgery on a Friday and was back at work Monday. The thing I remember the most was removing the strips they put over my stitches, steri strips I think? That was painful, but otherwise no big deal! I was told that there wasn‚Äôt much to remove but I could tell it helped in the months following and I‚Äôm happy that I went through with it.']
["Unfortunately when they were in there in February they found out that the endo was engulfing my colon and I would need a resection with a colorectal surgeon. They made the precaution of having me meet one prior to my first surgery and having him on site, but he only had an hour time block and wouldn't be able to complete it on that day... probably for the best because both of my surgeries ran almost 5 hours. I had the procedure done with Dr Tam. They found more endo the second time around, she cleared me out before and after he did the resection."]
['They say it can take 6 months for things to settle down post lap. My first was awful, second was lots better and then 3rd and 4th were terrible again ']
['It has been a month since my surgery. My three incisions have healed very well. I was off work for two weeks and the first few days back were a little rough but I got through. ']
['This. I took off a month after excision and then slowly worked back up to full time hours. It was about 12 weeks honestly before I felt more back to normal more or less.']
['That said, 16 days is not long at all. My doctor told me it can take six months to fully heal, though personally I felt 100% normal at about 3.5 months. ']


['Edited to add: I was back at work after two weeks, and felt back to normal after about four. The surgery itself took about two hours because my endometrioma was HUGE, but they were able to successfully get it out laparoscopically, because it ruptured inside the specimen bag when they were attempting to get it out.']
['I had a diagnostic lap who lasted about 3 hours and then a second one who lasted about 4. They found endo stage 4 and adenomyosis so there was a lot to remove. Surprisingly it took me less to recover from my second lap and I feel so much better! Best of luck']
["I had my lap on the 9th of this month, I was cleared for normal activity by my doc 2 weeks later but I don't feel fully up to snuff yet. *(Might be due to an internal infection, currently being monitored as one incision is looking icky. :c*)"]
["I'm a couple years out, very fair skinned, and mine are almost invisible. Including the longer scar used to remove my excised endo."]
['"The estimated retreatment rates were 3.3%, 4.7%, and 5.4% in the 2nd, 5th, and 8th year following hysterectomy, respectively, while the rates following laparoscopy were 15.8%, 27.5%, and 35.2%, respectively. ']
['I took 2 weeks off work after my second lap, a week after my first, and it was too soon. I didn‚Äôt feel 100% until about 6 weeks after the first and about 5 weeks after the second. ']
["My lap was less than a month ago, so the incisions haven't healed. But I had a lap gallbladder removal, and the scars are hardly noticeable. "]
['Do you know if you‚Äôre having laparoscopic or ‚Äúopen‚Äù surgery? My doc told me that laparoscopic healing is more like 2 to 3 weeks but an open surgery means a 4 - 5‚Äù incision and that can take longer to heal. ']
['Yep this was my second lap. My surgeon is a specialist so I‚Äôm not super worried that she missed endo. My first lap was in July and it wasn‚Äôt with a specialist.']
["One quick note to clarify: the daily pain has been going on for 3.5 years total (so the 10 months was part of that), not 4.5. I know, it's still a long time."]




Topic 2 Diagnosis and medical info on endo
cyst ovary uterus endometriosis cysts removed tissue ovaries ultrasound found left bowel remove adhesions endometrioma stage right one ovarian lesions could surgeon said lap cause

['With the right equipment and a suitably trained specialist doctor research shows that endometriosis involving either endometrioma (cysts on ovaries) or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) can be correctly diagnosed by TVUS the majority of the time.\nHowever, endometriosis that consists of small superficial lesions will not usually be seen this way. It is also important to note that the size and severity of the lesions does not correlate with the severity of the symptoms at all. So many endo patients will find that they have severe symptoms from superficial peritoneal lesions that cannot be seen on an scan.']
['I was diagnosed with stage four endometriosis at the age of 21 in October 2019. Endometriosis was found and excised on my bladder peritoneum, both ureters, both ovarian fossa, right ovary, and both uterosacral ligaments. I was found to have partial cul de sac obliteration (bowels) which was not excised. They also did not completely remove the fibrosis from my right uterosacral ligament. Adhesions were freed from both my ovaries and both my uterosacral ligaments were freed from my ureters. I had a small endometrioma on my left ovary that was drained. I am waiting to see an endometriosis surgeon that has knowledge of bowel endometriosis excision.']
['In many cases the only way to diagnose endo is via surgery. This is because endo lesions can be small and physically superficial and then they can‚Äôt be seen on any scans.\n \nIn physically severe cases (note this isn‚Äôt the same as severity of symptoms as physically mild endo can cause severe symptoms and vice versa) a specially trained doctor can often diagnose via transvaginal ultrasound as they can identify deep infiltrating lesions and endometriomas this way and also look for signs like adhesions or pouch of Douglas obliteration.']
['"Reproductive organs: The uterus is homogeneous. Bilateral ovaries are present containing physiologic follicles. No suspicious adnexal mass.\n \nExtraperitoneal soft tissues: There is a well-defined soft tissue structure situated within the distal aspect of the right rectus muscle measuring approximately 3.6 cm (AP by transverse by craniocaudal).\n1. Well-defined soft tissue structure situated within the distal aspect of the right rectus muscle measuring approximately 3.6 cm (craniocaudal extent), potentially representing the previously identified structure on outside ultrasound dating back to 2015 and ultrasound dated 2/10/2016. These findings may represent an endometrioma, however, a soft tissue malignancy cannot be excluded. Consider tissue sampling with FNA"']
['My post-operative diagnosis\n* Pelvic endometriosis - endo excised from rectum, posterior cul-de-sac, left pelvic sidewall, right perirectal space\n* Ovarian endometriosis\n* Significant adhesions had my left ovary stuck to my pelvic sidewall\n* Sigmoid colon adhesion to left abdominal wall\n* Ascending colon adhesion to right abdominal wall\n* Likely adenomyosis']
['Endo lesions can be very small and of superficial depth and yet still cause significant pain. Small superficial lesions are unlikely to be seen on any scanning and usually have to be diagnosed surgically. For this reason **a clear scan can never rule out the possibility of endometriosis**, scans can make a positive diagnosis when deep infiltrating lesions on endometrioma are seen, but cannot make a negative diagnosis.']
["So, endo can be superficial (meaning it exists on the surface layer) or infiltrating (which means it penetrates the tissue). Only infiltrating endo can be detected during a colonoscopy, because only the inside of the colon is being seen. It's possible that infiltrating endo is present but was not detected during the colonoscopy, which would mean that it hadn't penetrated the intestinal wall, but it's more likely to also be seen on an MRI than superficial endo because the infiltrating lesions are bigger. It's definitely possible to have EXTREME pain and have superficial lesions. "]
['Endo is currently defined by the presence of the lesions, but there are different types of lesions. Some evidence suggests that isolated peritoneal endometriosis may be a separate condition rather than an earlier or less spread form than cases including deep infiltrating lesions. This might also explain the paradoxical lack of correlation between the severity of the symptoms experienced and the physical extent of the disease.']
["I had an incomplete colonoscopy prior to my diagnosis because they could not get the camera through.Turns out I had a cyst the size of a grapefruit that had fused to and blocked my intestines. During my surgery, the couldn't find my appendix, and had discovered that, that to was blocking my intestines, but was also being pushed through it. I had two bowel resections in addition to the removal of Endo. That was my diagnostic surgery. :( I would definitely follow up with your doctor. A blocked intestine can lead to a perforated bowel. "]
['"No other active endometriotic implants were seen although there was evidence of scarring in the cul-de-sac and on the left side of the bladder peritoneum. ..... The cul-de-sac was examined and there had been some adhesions of the cyst to the cul-de-sac. The peritoneum was disrupted in several areas due to these adhesions, but there was no active bleeding and no evidence of trauma to the bowel or other adjacent structures."']


['‚ÄúEndometriosis is the disease. The lining of the uterus is called the endometrium; hence, and endometrial cyst is a cyst in the lining of the uterus. And endometrioma and chocolate cyst are used interchangeably. An ovarian cyst of endometriosis (an endometrioma) often has bleeding within it.‚Äú ']
["If you have endometriosis that wasn't just on the ovaries and uterus, and the endometriosis wasn't excised, then...yeah. It's still there. And it doesn't even have to be DIE...it could be on your pelvic wall, cul-de-sac, ureter, bladder, bowel, on a nerve, on your diaphragm, around your lungs...just anywhere."]
['Unfortunately MRI often doesn‚Äôt catch endo :( I had severe endo (deep infiltrating endo) on my uterus, ovaries, bladder, uterosacral ligaments, both small &amp; large bowels but nothing showed up on MRI or any other images. This is why the surgery is usually called ‚Äúdiagnostic‚Äù because many won‚Äôt know they have endo until they have the surgery for it. ']
["I was diagnosed via ultrasound and mri. Kissing ovaries, DIE, ademyonosis. Cysts are 6.5cm and 4 cm. I think they do show up. Since it's already level 3 or 4 endo. Mri will show cysts. But I'm not sure about lesions. Mri can miss a lot, but not the cysts. They will show."]
['I had my endo diagnosed last year on a lap which was too complex to be removed. They left a nodule in the junction between my bladder and left ureter which could eventually affect my kidneys if it were to grow. It was not picked up maybe due to the size or that its hidden away/not clear in that location.']
['1. Via scanning when an endo lesion or endometrioma is positively identified this way. Unfortunately many endo lesions are tiny and physically superficial (but still cause severe symptoms), so a negative (clear) scan result can never rule out the possibility of endo.']
['A current leading theory is that some forms of endometriosis are a type of autoimmune disease. According to this theory, changes in the way the peritoneum (lining of the abdomen) related to multiple factors could allow the cells from normal retrograde menstruation to be able to stick to the peritoneum and form lesions. This could be the method of formation for superficial peritoneal lesions, which are a common form of endometriosis (possibly the most common).']
["This is because whilst some people have large endometriotic nodules, endometriomas and features like adhesions or obliterated pouch of douglas which can be seen on ultrasound scans or MRI, other people have micro deposits of endometriosis which can't be seen on scans and can only be discovered via surgery."]
['Endometriosis can be diagnosed via ultrasound but a clear ultrasound can‚Äôt exclude the possibility of endometriosis. Whether endo can be seen on ultrasound depends on the type, size and location of the endo lesions, the experience and training of the ultrasound operator and the equipment used.']
['External Abdominal ultrasound is incredibly unlikely to show anything (unless you have a huge cyst). An ultrasound needs to be done with an internal probe and ideally performed by a doctor specifically trained in ultrasound diagnostic technique.']


['So this means you have mild endometriosis in the space behind your uterus and around the left ovary (but not within it). Also there is scar tissue attaching the lower part of your large intestine to the inner wall of abdomen.']
['My MRI was clear but during my lap they found endo on my uterosacral ligaments, pelvic sidewalls, pelvic brim, sigmoid colon, appendix and bladder. Endo usually needs to be pretty severe to show up on scans.']
['"The uterosacral ligament, in addition to the posterior cul‚Äêde‚Äêsac, is the most common pelvic sites of involvement in deep pelvic endometriosis, with specificity for the diagnosis of uterosacral ligament endometriosis greater than 90% on MRI."']
["I have stage 4/DIE and the only thing that ever showed up on imaging were ovarian cysts and once I had surgery w/ an expert they found that all my pelvic organs were fused together with endo, I have it on my rectum and bowels. Is there a reason that they won't perform a lap?"]
["My ovary is already out of place because of the endo, but I'm pretty sure it's even more displaced now because when the ultrasound tech was looking for the cyst, she found it on my left side and couldn't find my right ovary on the right at all because it had shifted over.."]
['For me the mri showed:\nCysts in both ovaries\nInflamed left fallopian tube\nBoth tubes filled with blood\nAdhesions \nOvaries stuck to bowels in two places \nHow far the endo had infiltrated the bowel.']
['Endometriosis of the ovaries (endometrioma), large deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) and endometriotic nodules should show up on either MRI or ultrasound when performed by an expert, but it is possible to have DIE which is missed by scans.']
["They found endo on my ureter (along with all over my pelvis - I had stage 4). It was removed via excision surgery. A highly skilled excision surgeon can generally remove endo on a ureter. I can't really discern what pain was caused by what, so I'm not sure if I ever had symptoms from it."]
['Lesions is just a word to describe what endo is. Having endo means having bits of specific tissue (lesions) in places where it shouldn‚Äôt be. This can be in the form of cysts such as endometrioma or what is called ‚Äúsuperficial lesions‚Äù (a bit like spots, streaks or other marks of tissue) on the inside linings of the abdomen, or what is called ‚Äúdeep infiltrating lesions‚Äù (which is lumps of endo tissue deeper found in other normal tissues).']
['Well. When the surgeon opened me up, turned out I had Stage IV endo. It was all over my abdomen, with adhesions "pulling my organs together in a bundle of scar tissue" as she described it. My appendix (which is on the right side of the body) was adhered to my *left* ovary. Thankfully the surgeon was able to take out all the endo and scar tissue (though some scar tissue grew later where my tube was removed).']




Topic 3 pelvic floor issues and therapy
pelvic floor therapy physical help sex helped therapist muscles lot issues chronic dysfunction could things anxiety mental health cause may work exercises helps well painful

['Finally, therapy. Lots of therapy. But since you have trauma you may benefit from a somatic approach. There are PTs who work with women with pelvic floor disorders (and sometimes do pelvic floor work form endo patients) so if you are more comfortable with that idea you may be able to desensitize yourself that way as well. ']
["* **What if I experience discomfort performing any of these exercises?**\n   * These exercises are very low impact and easy to perform, but if you start having worsening pain associated with them, don't force yourself. The only time I felt discomfort during physical therapy was on internal exercises; these external exercises should be relaxing and not cause discomfort. Try focusing on the breathing exercises first and doing what you can for the other exercises.\n* **What if pelvic floor physical therapy doesn't appear to be helping me?**\n   * Pelvic floor physical therapy cannot solve everything, but it can be a part of a holistic approach to resolving pelvic issues. Please mention concerns to your pelvic floor physical therapist.\n   * I do not yet have first-hand experience with them, but pelvic floor injections can also be beneficial in relaxing the pelvic floor.\n* **If I experience pain during sex or arousal, should I continue having sex while going through pelvic floor physical therapy?**\n   * This is extremely tricky. I did not have sex or experience arousal while going through my pelvic floor physical therapy. Because your body can tense in expectation of pain, you could be making the issue worse. My therapist said having a painful sexual experience in the midst of therapy can immensely set you back. I would recommend seeing a pelvic floor physical therapist about this."]
['Looking up pelvic floor stretches to learn about un-tensing those muscles may be helpful, kegels are not that. Pelvic floor therapists teach deep breathing, pelvic floor drops, certain gentle stretches, and then after significant progress has been made you can work on strengthening exercises. ']
['Massage is both internal and external, but in my experience, it is mostly internal. Your PT will manually massage your internal muscles to relax points of tension. They do this so that your muscles are not constantly tensed, as that weakens your pelvic floor and leads to pain. \nTherapists can use devices, but I‚Äôve only had experience with manual massage. ']
['I found physical therapy to be a great help.  And learned a lot of interesting exercises to try to help loosen up my tense pelvis, etc.  Its a bit awkward at first but pelvic physical therapy does have its place in at least learning some pain management.']
['Have you tried pelvic floor physical therapy already? Pelvic floor disorder (pfd) Is another cause of painful sex. A lot of us with endo also have pfd, and it can occur on it‚Äôs own as well. If your only symptom is pain with sex, it‚Äôd be worth exploring that treatment option. ']
["I highly recommend going to pelvic floor physical therapy, not just googling exercises. A lot of exercises can make things worse if you don't know specifically what is going on. A therapist can determine which muscles need to be targeted and tailor a program to help."]
['Might be worth looking into a pelvic floor physiotherapist. Might not be the problem but sometimes a lot of my muscles get tense to kind of guard from the pain. So maybe they can help with some relaxation techniques if that is the case for you. It helped me quite a bit.']
['Also seconding pelvic floor therapy. My therapist is WONDERFUL, and she takes a holistic approach to helping with pelvic floor dysfunction (including some yoga to help relax the body since my pelvic floor is tight).']
['I would highly recommend seeing a pelvic floor pt for long term treatment. I have been seeing one for a while now and sciatic pain is one of the main things that she addresses. It‚Äôs helped so much and greatly improved my quality of life.']


['I just started Pelvis Physiotherapy to help me relax my pelvic muscles. Really helpful! I did not realized that tight muscles play such a huge role with Endometriosis.']
["Are you having any other treatments other than just seeing the gynae? I recommend a pelvic floor physio, the one I see has worked wonders for my bladder issues and helping to relax when things are painful so spasm doesn't add more to it. Also recommend a chronic pain psychologist, one that deals with pelvic pain and endo."]
["Yep, I used to have this daily until I went to physical therapy. For me, it was due to the severe pelvic floor dysfunction I developed due to years of dealing with endo. A combination of physical therapy, laparoscopy, and diet changes helped a lot! Now I only get it when I'm bad with my diet..."]
['I always get pain with sex and after sex for awhile. I recently started pelvic floor therapy and she said its because i have a weak pelvic floor in some areas. ']
['Also ask to see a pelvic floor physical therapist - you may have pelvic floor dysfunction and physical therapy can help you a ton. ']
['I have pelvic congestion syndrome in addition to endo. PCS pain is often worsened after exercise even outside of your cycle and is associated with painful sex/sexual activity.']
['There are many factors that can ease symptoms. Are you in a better place mentally? (Less stress etc) dietary tweaks? These could have an impact.']
['Yes, I do. Based on your description it sounds like it could be pelvic floor muscle spasms. Have you considered seeing a pelvic floor PT? It‚Äôs been very helpful for me.']
['Have they talked to you about pelvic floor dysfunction? I‚Äôm wondering if that could be causing some of your pain with sex. It‚Äôs a factor for me, and I‚Äôve been doing pelvic floor physical therapy for it. It‚Äôs helping.']
["Yoga can help with pelvic floor dysfunction and significantly reduce pain for some people. It helped me a lot. But it doesn't treat the underlying issue unfortunately."]


["I also second the pelvic floor therapy idea. Chronic endometriosis pain can cause your pelvic muscles to become permanently tense to the point you don't notice when you even started tensing. Even with the endo gone, your muscles could still be reflexively tensing and causing you pain due to living with it for so long."]
['Many people in your circumstances seem to find some success with pelvic floor physiotherapy. This is helpful for many chronic pain conditions (including endo) as these often include an element of pelvic floor dysfunction.']
['I found pelvic floor physical therapy for my tight muscles and EMDR therapy for past sexual abuse extremely helpful. I\'m not "fixed", but sex has been getting much better for me over the years!']
['I think the pain leads to muscular weakness in us and this then causes musculoskeletal issues which makes the pain so much worse with secondary pain. In my head if I can avoid the secondary pain, at least the primary pain (the directly caused by endo pain) will be easier to deal with. ']
["The only thing that helped my urgency issues was pelvic floor physical therapy. Basically since my pelvic floor muscles had lost the ability to relax, it was putting pressure on my bladder - tense pelvic floor muscles signal that you have to go, even if you don't actually. It's a whole thing."]
['Yoga is great because it includes Pelvic floor relaxation exercises. Part of "endo pain" is usually Pelvic Floor Dysfunction- releasing the Pelvic floor and breathing, focusing on mindfulness all decease stress and relax muscles we tighten when we are in pain. Great going on finding a source of relief!']
['Aside from physical conditions I also have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, OCD, clinical anxiety, psychosis and schizophrenia.']
['Endo made my preexisting depression worse too. It‚Äôs quite common. Inflammation has been linked to depression and well, we get lots of it. ']
['Is it pelvic floor therapy that was recommend? That can definitely help with pain management and reducing tension in your pelvic floor. ']

Topic 4 getting diagnosed/unknown symptoms
symptoms blood could ultrasound bladder test issues tests doctor endometriosis normal cause see something infection said back diagnosed think anything mri sure done show pcos

["The more I read about this disease the more I wonder if this was the reason for 3 ER visits due to severe upper stomach issues that they could find no reason (did endoscopy--clear. MRI--clear. Ultrasound--clear. Celiac test/blood tests--clear)? And wondering if it's on my appendix because the MRI said they couldn't find an appendix and I've never had it removed/burst. "]
["Of course I don't mind. They tested lungs and sinuses for the any sign of infection (clear), for appendicitis (clear), ovaries and uterus for any abnormalities (clear) and check the blood twice for signs of infection. They didn't test for latent infections, tho. \nI also have thyroid issues &amp; gastritis but they think it's not the cause."]
['Hm, interesting you say that! It could be possible - I‚Äôve not got confirmed endo but I have all the symptoms etc. Previous ultrasounds has shown what looks like PCOS but other symptoms didn‚Äôt match up and neither did blood work so it was ruled out. I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs possible though as an ultrasound probably can‚Äôt pick up the differences too clearly.']
['Depending on your precise symptoms there are a bunch of other things I can think of that could be causing this (mostly quite rare), but a lot of these things could be ruled out with blood tests etc. and perhaps they have already (I am thinking of things like periodic fever syndromes or porphyria).']
['"A biliary obstruction is a blockage of the bile ducts. The bile ducts carry bile from the liver and gallbladder through the pancreas to the small intestine. A biliary obstruction may be caused by a number of factors involving the bile ducts, liver, gallbladder, pancreas."']
["The bad news is even a GYN can't conclusively diagnose for you. A good one can be relatively certain based on the clues you and your GP provide, but the only way to know 100% is if they do a lap surgery and actually look - I say this not to get you down, but just so you know what to expect. Your gynae may want you to get an ultrasound if you haven't already because sometimes endo can be visible (or commonly comorbid conditions like fibroids/adenomyosis, or ovarian cysts), but even that's often not perfect. An ultrasound may be totally clear but you could very well still have it hiding. "]
['They are separate conditions.  Other things that can cause ‚Äúendo-like‚Äù symptoms, and are also known to co-occur with endo (some are even *more likely to occur* if you have endo): Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Lupus, Crohns, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, vascular compressions, various cancers...and that‚Äôs just off the top of my head!']
['You should look into Pelvic Congestion Syndrome which is now called Pelvic Venous Hypertension. What you‚Äôre describing sounds eerily familiar. The condition can be caused spontaneously or by another venous issue that causes it to develop. It can cause varicosities in the pelvis, which sounds like what you‚Äôre going through. ']
['CA125 levels are elevated in many cases of severe endometriosis, but this can‚Äòt be used as a diagnostic test as they are elevated in many conditions (essentially any condition which causes chronic inflammation in the pelvic region will show elevated CA125 blood level).']
["I was seeing a GI doctor, and between him and my PCP, have had numerous tests done (all of which have come up negative): CT scan of my stomach area, MRI scans, ultrasounds, a colonoscopy, testing for Celiac's disease, and more. Nothing suspicious ever came up from any of this, and I'm so uncomfortable/miserable. My doctors didn't have any suggestions since all those tests proved nothing, so I mostly gave up. However, since it seems to be more and more of a hormonal/reproductive-related issue, I'm now considering seeing a gyno about these symptoms (which I hadn't thought to do before)."]


['Could be, but i believe there are other things that could cause this. Have you had a lap to diagnose endo at all? It might be worth going to a gastroenterologist to rule out other causes- if it‚Äôs something you can see/deal with without surgery, it‚Äôs worth checking!']
['Secondary POTS can be caused by any number of conditions.  Compressions cause secondary POTS by the disruption of blood flow.  They can also cause venous insufficiency, which also causes the symptoms.  ']
["That is really interesting, actually. My primary doctor suspected I might have PCOS, but my gynecologist and neurologist suggest endometriosis. I read that PCOS doesn't cause pain, though -- is this true? "]
['I have Crohn‚Äôs and Bowel Endo. I definitely have mucus/tissue like substance due to both. What IBD are you diagnosed with and is it in remission? A lot of my symptoms overlap for both diseases. Do you have any other signs of endo besides the bowel symptoms?']
['Totally normal for endo not to show up on imaging, by the way. That\'s why so many doctors who don\'t know anything about endo will say "well, there\'s nothing on the scan, so you must be fine". That is false. Endo is sneaky.']
['I am being evaluated for vascular compression syndromes like MALS and nutcracker. But I was wondering if endo could potentially cause tachycardia too or grow on veins, causing them to get squeezed or something??']
['Endo can definitely cause urinary symptoms and it can also affect your kidneys in severe cases. Another possibility may be interstitial cystitis. I would definitely bring this up with your gyn.']
['CA125 is an inflammatory marker test. It is used sometimes to to check for uterine cancer as well, so don‚Äôt get too alarmed. It is used as a sort of guideline for endo and is in no way definitive.']
['Cystoscopy is fairly simple for them to do. I had one done during my laparoscopy to check for interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which is a common thing to have along with endo. Have they mentioned that it could be that?']
["If it's coming back more frequently then it could be endo. You should definitely have your doctor rule out cysts and fibroids. A quick blood test and an ultrasound will rule out a ton of things."]


['Ah! That does sound more like Endo, but still definitely see your doctor. They will want to rule out any other possibilities. Anything that causes inflammation in the pelvis could be causing this.']
['Have they investigated non-gynaecological causes for your pain? The recent symptoms you describe could be caused by an infection in your intestine or inflamed appendix etc.']
["Typically they have a general diagnosis based on symptoms.  You won't get a true diagnosis until you have a lap and the doc sends a bit of your uterus for pathology."]
['I had MRI, CT Scan and transvaginal scans prior to my lap, all which showed nothing except small fibroids. A lap is the only definitive way to know. ']
['A little especially since I have a history of ulcers and digestive issues but my doctor is aware and I have regular blood tests to check on my liver. ']
['That‚Äôs really useful to know that the symptoms could be associated with endo! I always thought it would be a possibility but the doctors I have seen said there was no issue there, but it definitely doesn‚Äôt seem right. ']
['You are unlikely to get a diagnosis from the ER unless there is something obviously wrong that will appear on a basic scan or blood test. They may be able to tell if you have fibroids or ovarian cysts and they can rule out other serious causes of abdominal pain such as ovarian torsion or appendicitis.']
['They ran all the required tested to check for things like appendicitis. I had been in the ER for similar reasons in the past. This doctor was different though. Instead of just saying I had constipation or something, he suggested it sounded like something I should see an OBGYN for, and he suggested that it sounded like endometriosis to him. ']
['Hmm I never thought of that. I had blood tests and everything checked prior by my GP to rule out any other issues, and when my gyno did an ultrasound he also checked my liver and gallbladder and everything checked out fine which led him to the diagnosis of endo (as I only ever get the pain when something is happening with my uterus)']
["I would be more concerned about your urination issues. I'm sure there are many other bladder related conditions that doctors would look into before jumping to the idea of bladder endo, and there will be tests that they can do before something like a laparoscopy to rule those things out. You definitely need to see your doctor about this if you haven't already."]




Topic 5 period
period periods days bleeding symptoms painful heavy cramps started normal day month time years since first bad every cycle always months last blood still worse

['I thought that was the end of the weirdness! But it got worse. Ever since that month, I‚Äôve been bleeding almost constantly. Medium flow, thick brown/usually totally black, no pain anywhere. I‚Äôll go a month of straight bleeding, have a couple days off, have a couple days of brown spotting, another two weeks of black period, then a couple days of nothing, then another few weeks of black period, etc. During the ‚Äúnothing‚Äù days, I have white discharge streaked with brown and red blood. I haven‚Äôt had a normal, red period since the beginning of December 2020.']
['Yesterday (July 16) I began to bleed a lot, like a full period again. I was warned that "some light spotting" can occur but no, this is a heavy flow of blood, not just light spotting (I\'ve had to wear super tampons, and they\'ve been filling up very quickly). I have cramps, appetite changes, and fatigue. It feels like this is my second period of the month, but I thought my period ended around the 14th so how did this happen only 2 days afterwards? The blood is fresh new blood, too (I thought spotting was usually old/dark period blood but this seems like new blood).']
['I (F 20) started my period in fourth grade, about the age of 9. My periods were consistently long (at least ten days) and extremely heavy (going through more than one box of ultra tampons each month) from the beginning but, they were **pain-free.** I had this type of period for about seven years, until I was put on birth control. After I started taking the pill, my periods became more "normal", and completely changed within three years. It was then, at 19, that I was diagnosed with ovarian cysts and endometriosis. ']
['Hello all. I have not officially been diagnosed with endometriosis although it has been suspected for some time. Ever since puberty my periods are HELL. Literally bleeding through clothes, intense pelvic and low back cramps. I had my daughter and got an iud and that has helped with the bleeding however I still have daily pelvic pain, low back pain, nausea, severe fatigue, bloating, and either diarrhea or constipation as well as reoccurring ovarian cysts. ']
["* Pain during sex\n* Blood after sex the last time\n* Crazy fatigue (could be due to my schedule)\n* Severe PMS craps, sometimes no PMS cramps at all\n* Random stabbing pains (happening now about two weeks after my period)\n* Period is often a few days late. It's extremely heavy to begin with (I'm lucky if I can get a Super tampon to *not* leak after a few hours) then I'd really light the last day. My period is typically only 3-5 days"]
["Over time and as I got older, my periods became increasingly heavy. I never had issues with bleeding or spotting at that time, and for a long time my periods were heavily irregular. I went through a period of time between the ages of 12-13 where I didn't get my period for 3 months, and this happened again from ages 19-20. I went through skipping my period every other month, to one month having a cycle that lasted 5 days, next month 7, next month 5, etc."]
['I started my period when I was 11 and it was terrible, my period lasted for a whole year and was dark red and super heavy, blood clots, terrible cramps. I started birth control at 12 and have been on birth control for 12 years. I got off birth control at 21 years old for about 6 months and period was regular coming every 28 days like clockwork for 5-6 days. I went back on it after 6 months because I became sexually active.']
['I‚Äôm not sure if I have it or not because I have normal periods my cramping isn‚Äôt too bad but I get a lot of clotting but then again usually their not any bigger than a quarter maybe like one or two big clots during my period but that‚Äôs it and recently my period has been heavier but only on the first two full days. And I‚Äôve been getting back cramps when I cramp more so than stomach but that‚Äôs been happening the past like 4 years or so but none of my symptoms are too severe though so I‚Äôm not sure if I could have this?']
["Second, my periods are waaaaaaaay heavier now. But that's not what's weird, I'm used to a heavy flow. What's weird is that it starts heavy, and stays heavy, and at the end it just suddenly stops. Before surgery the first day would be spotting, the next three days would be heavy, then spotting, then two more heavy days, then finally a day of spotting. It would basically taper in, then taper off. Now it just gushes before stopping suddenly with no spotting at the end or the beginning. "]
["I'm 22 now and the bc helped a lot but this past year or so, my symptoms got worse again and my cycles got wonky. One period was 10 days light but otherwise normal. The next one was about 10 days early and lasted about 12 days with bad cramping and bleeding for 7 of those 12 days (usual period is about a week with the worst of the cramping and bleeding happening during the first 2 or 3 days)."]


['That sounds a lot like mine too and when I had the surgery there was a ton of it. The pain wasn‚Äôt too bad besides when I was on my period and they were super heavy. Also not sure if you‚Äôre sexually active but I was 18 when I was diagnosed and had the surgery and I noticed that sex hurt a lot and sometimes still does even after the surgery but not nearly as bad.']
['I quit birth control because for me it actually worsened my endo symptoms: heavier periods that became progressively longer (1 super tampon + overnight pad every 30 min to an hour, for 10+ weeks with a week off between periods), and made my pain worse. ']
['I definitely felt like this! Growing up my Mum and sister always had worse period pains than I did (throwing up even as teenagers) so it wasn‚Äôt till I had increased nausea and back pain with periods (thanks to endo on my bowel!) that I even dared to get looked at.']
["I do. It started frequently hurting outside my period week from the start. Technically before that, because i began experiencing uterine pain around 11, and i got my first period a month before i hit 13. But it didnt become daily til i was 17ish. I'm now 20 and still have it."]
["It has stopped my period. It didn't happen right away though. I've been on it for 8 months now, and I haven't had a period in 4 1/2 months. I had spotting for the first couple months on and off. I had 2 full blown periods in the first few months, but my pain on them was less than usual. Now I have no bleeding."]
['I don‚Äôt know if I have endo, but I have quite a few symptoms. Cramps and back pain, bad bloating, painful penetration, lots of clots, periods are becoming increasingly irregular (still comes every month but it varies a lot, which isn‚Äôt normal for me), fatigue.']
["As for my cycle, I got my first period at 14 and I initially went on BC at 15 because I wouldnt get my period for months and then randomly I'd get it and it would last for a month. My cycles were always abnormal and I always had breakthrough bleeding, especially if I missed my pill by just an hour. I was diagnosed at 26."]
["I have endo and usually have horrible periods and a decent amount of bleeding. Not extremely heavy but definitely more than average. Two months ago I had a light period with no pain after not having a period for 50 days, then 28 days later I had a normal one with the normal pain and bleeding. Now 27 days later I have a light period and no pain again! I was so shocked when I got it because I usually PMS badly a week before and I didn't. Anyone experience this? Is it normal to go light to heavy to light?"]
['Also I‚Äôve had my periods for two years and my periods have been a lot lighter than before but the past two months it‚Äôs like they‚Äôve gone back to my pre-iud periods and are super heavy I‚Äôm bleeding thru ultra tampons again. Why would it suddenly go back?']
['I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs normal, but I did bleed watery red blood during the beginning of my pregnancy and had cramping. It went back and forth between light red, brown, tinged discharge. Then by 8 weeks it stopped. My mom bled on and off through her whole pregnancy with me.']


['- Heavy irregular bleeding, it can last from 5 to 14 days. I‚Äôll pass clots, sometimes I‚Äôll have a ‚Äònormal‚Äô period but will bleed (brownish-pinkish blood) for the next two weeks. I got my period when I was 11. ']
['This last couple of months has been hell for my period. Around July 11th, I started with what I thought was my period, only to have it start and stop a few days at a time until July 25th, when it started for real. ']
['I had a new symptom last week:   \nI had severe pain on Thursday (not on my period) which is not abnormal but on Saturday, I started bleeding after sex. It is more spotting than anything else and has changed to brown spotting now. It is really light. ']
["if it's two weeks before your period is due, you might honestly be ovulating. I bleed and get worse cramps than my period during ovulation every month, might be coincidence or the overexertion caused it to worsen?"]
["I haven't missed a period. I just ended mine on the 4th and then started cramping like it was coming back just over a week later. I don't usually bleed outside my period, and I haven't this month, yet."]
['I have had a couple of 60 day cycles inbetween periods recently, and when I finally start- it is the worst pain I have ever felt. My cramps are always painful- but definitely the worst when I have skipped a month or two.']
['F28 think I may have endo. About a year ago I started having IBS symptoms, mostly constipation and missed a period. Historically I‚Äôd had pretty regularly short cycles that weren‚Äôt painful. ']
['I have a pretty short cycle too (26 days on average) so I think I get around 5 days without pain. Usually from right before my period to after I ovulate. And I get spotting for most of the month even though I‚Äôm on the pill which is annoying. ']
["Has anyone noticed their breasts looking larger right before their period? I've noticed this the past couple months, I'm not pregnant and it only happens right before my period. They're also tender. Could this be endo related maybe?"]
['However, this month has been different. My cycle didn‚Äôt occur until after 29 days last month. I started spotting goopy/mucous-y blood in the two days leading up to my ovulation and am spotting even more now, after it. Pregnancy is not a possibility. ']

Topic 7 dismissal or abuse
people even doctors think feel something say one want women never tell doctor way thing many bad wrong told going much body life sorry said

["Wow I'm so sorry you're going through that. Especially after explaining to her about endometriosis. That's a demand and no one should tell you what to do. Who the hell is she to tell you to get your shit together??? If that ever happens to me I will blow up. Honestly after many years of pain and misunderstanding from my managers and coworkers, I've come to realize fuck everyone who ever dares to ever tell me what to do about my condition. Its better to be direct and honest and emotional than to ignore it. Ignoring it makes it worse."]
["Endo is a very personal disease.  Just because one woman does something, that doesn't mean that another woman with the exact same condition is going to do the exact same thing.  So keep in mind that we don't know enough about it yet to understand why it works that way, but it DOES work that way.  Nobody is crazy and the diagnosis isn't necessarily wrong if one woman's symptoms aren't the same as another woman's.  "]
['Your comments below are dismissive and diminishes this other person‚Äôs pain. Maybe you loved your doc. Science and medicine sure are important but it‚Äôs not this universal thing where having any medical degree means you know what you‚Äôre talking about. That‚Äôs absurd. The field of health is really inconsistent, especially in the US. We have this issue of gendered and ethnocentric medicine that kills a lot of people. It‚Äôs not just about endo. The whole system sucks.']
['No. This is the point that made me angry and I‚Äôm *still* thinking about it. I *NEVER* said any of that. And to claim I am is deeply insulting and concerning. I respect your opinion and feelings, but I never made any of these claims or assumptions, and you are asserting them on me for *no reason.* Please don‚Äôt do this. I never once said or even implied that PTSD is not a disability. Comparing PTSD to endo does not make it not a disability.']
['Yes I was having a hard time lately and was telling my mom, I rarely discuss my pain because I don‚Äôt want it to be annoying. She told me other people have it worse than me or I could have a worse condition, like I know that!? But can‚Äôt I ever have a bad day!? Especially when she complains constantly about her treatable problems she refuses to fix. I know she didn‚Äôt mean it in a mean way but it‚Äôs so frustrating']
["Honestly, you're probably right about PTSD. And, honestly, out of all the traumatic bullshit I've gone through, never once did I think my depression was from PTSD. It really gives me pause because wow! I think you're right! A lot of us probably have PTSD from this shitty disease on top of being treated like lowly pieces of shit on the bottom of their medical shoes. "]
["I've had to just be very clear about what I need and expect. I told my partner very clearly that when I'm in pain, I generally like him to pretend it's not happening.  I had to explain to him that being fussed over makes me feel bad for causing others discomfort and I can't deal with that while I'm in pain.  I also had to explain that I already feel pathetic and broken when I'm in pain and that makes me want to do everything on my own to prove that I'm not completely useless. "]
['Been through 2 nurse practitioners and 4 docs so far, each has made the trauma worse. It‚Äôs not you we‚Äôre mad at, it‚Äôs the fact we‚Äôve been put through this mess and ignored and gaslit for years because of how misogynistic the medical field is. When all that frustration gets flung around, it makes it seem like we hate y‚Äôall. It‚Äôs nothing personal against you guys! We‚Äôre just letting it out.']
['Its sad that professionals who\'s job is to help can make you feel so needy. I think also a lot stop seeing patients as people and its like "how many can i see in a day" which is where these cases slip through the cracks because they aren\'t genuinely listening to the person about their body but moreso trying to slap a diagnosis on. ']
['When we experience pain, generally this means we\'re in danger. Our nervous system sends "danger" signals to our brain to tell us "hey!! Something isn\'t right here, pay attention to this and fix it!!!!" This is a survival mechanism, pain keeps us alive by alerting us when something is wrong and needs to be tended to.\xa0']


["Jesus, that's humiliating and extremely rude. I'm so sorry. I couldn't resist, I would make such a scene out of this, I would educate this lady SO hard she would never do this to anyone again. Your body is not anybody's business, and insisting on top of that is just.... Ugh!"]
['How awful!! I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through that! People can be awful! I hate that argument, that it could be worse, It‚Äôs so invalidating.  Being down and frustrated with a disease that is chronic and causes debilitating pain is perfectly normal and I want you to know you I hear you and your feelings are valid üíõ']
['Nobody truly knows how our symptoms are until they‚Äôve experienced it. However someone educated in that field you‚Äôd think you could talk to them about it while they kept an open mind? Or even just listened to the facts coming from your mouth?']
['\nSo essentially they now claim to have Endo and every single time they come up with a new disability, I do my research. The thing here is, eventually this family member will be sick. So on that notion, I kind of fall for it every single time. ']
["My wife says the same exact thing every time I speak up about male doctors.... She said she has been railroaded far worse by female doctors believe it or not and I'm like, damn...... Y'all have to put up with so much shit...."]
["Don't accept being dismissed. Go to as many doctors as you need until you find one that takes your symptoms seriously. Make each one of them fully aware of your past negative experiences with BC and history of your ED. You deserve to be heard. You deserve to be taken seriously. You deserve to have answers. You deserve to live your best life. This is your body and your health, you are the one experiencing this. Be your biggest advocate."]
['Complete agreed. I owe nobody sex and if my boyfriend would make me feel like I did I\'d fuck right off. I know it\'s easier to say than do but you\'re a strong ass person. You have Endo. Not everyone in life gets to know chronic pain. And I mean that\'s a good thing for them but we will always be "lazy", "not giving sex", "always in pain", "unreliable" people can say what they want. There is only one actual word for it, sick. We are sick. It\'s not our fucking fault that we got sick. Fuck this sickness and fuck people who abuse us in our vulnerable state. I\'m so sorry for what happened to you.']
['It is so hard when something like that happens- but remember when someone says multiple things meant to devalue you and dismiss your pain- you can choose to let that person go, even though it is really hard. I am so sorry you had that experience']
["That being said, this remark could only come from a good doctor! So many have shrugged it off or ignored me when I've explained that I'm always in pain to some extent. Doctors who believe that women's pain isn't normal are a rare breed."]
['Jesus. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. I understand not feeling comfortable when speaking up about symptoms. It feels awful having everything caged up inside you. I hope one day that people will stop dismissing our pain. /:']


['I am so sorry about your suicidal thoughts, and I agree that it is absolutely criminal the way we are treated. But in all honesty, I think this stuff continues because there aren‚Äôt enough people throwing fits about their mistreatment and holding these doctors accountable. We all think that this is just what medicine is because this is everyone‚Äôs experience. Literally everyone I know with a chronic illness has gone through this. ']
['I‚Äôm so sorry that you‚Äôve had to go through all this. It‚Äôs such a frustrating disease and it definitely feels like you‚Äôre lying to yourself about how bad it is sometimes. I literally had a doctor say the pain was all in my head, so I didn‚Äôt seek additional treatment for a long time. Believe me, you are not making this up, and there‚Äôs no reason why anyone would. I wish that society would have an easier time believing people (esp women) when they say they‚Äôre in pain.']
['Unless I\'m grossly mistaken, your bf is a manipulative abusive POS.  He lied to you about what your Dr said to dismiss your health issues.  If he lied to do this, he also knew that your health issues were very much real (and in fact, not your Dr\'s diagnosis).  He undermined you and medical staff with the sole intent of controlling you to get what he felt he was "owed" in your relationship.  He has no place in your life.']
['I believe at times women are stigmatized and labeled with sexist behaviors such as ‚Äúbeing too dramatic‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing too sensitive‚Äù that doctors forget to see us as people with valid feelings and concerns. We should not settle when doctor‚Äôs tell us what to feel, if we are genuinely feeling like shit. We feel what we feel and no one else can tell you to change that.']
['Too many people have stories like these, it‚Äôs insane how often we‚Äôre treated like we‚Äôre too stupid or irrational to know what‚Äôs happening to our own bodies. I‚Äôve always said I‚Äôll never trust a doctor again but my god do I appreciate the nurses. They are the ones who fought for me, spent time explaining what was going on, treated me like a human being with a fully functioning brain.']
['What a load!! To put that into you‚Äôre head that you might have cancer is so freaking stressful. What an absolute joke of a doctor. You need to find someone else that will help you and care for you...']

Topic 8 post-op recovery
day days first home time around back gas hours week take much felt got took walk hospital work went weeks bed recovery feel could still

['Pain was nothing close to what my endo pain was like. I felt better right after the surgery. I had a long drive so my anesthesiologists gave me nerve block shots where my incisions were and that helped for a day or so. When I was just sitting on the couch it felt like I had done an ab work out for two hours. When I got up it was pretty painful or if I walked/exerted too much (aka went to the kitchen and the bathroom with out a break haha). Again it was nothing like the pain I was in with my endo. The main pain lasted about 4 days then slowly moved to just being painful if I exerted myself too much. After a week and a half I was off all my pain killers.']
['Those are all the tips I can think of! Personally, my recovery wasn‚Äôt too bad. The first 2 days were pretty rough, but I started feeling better by day 3. I think being able to shower that day made a huge difference, to be honest. By day 10, I felt great and I was totally back to normal by day 14. Some people need longer, and that‚Äôs ok! Just listen to your body and be careful not to overdo it. I think I recovered so quickly because I really made sure not to push myself. ']
['(20F) I had my lap in March and the recovery was fully fine. I woke from surgery completely coherent, went right home, and hung out. For me, I didn‚Äôt actually get shoulder pain. I had tenderness at the incisions and felt kind of sore for the first day or two, but by day 3 I was operating as normal. Getting up and down the first day was sore and slightly painful, but I was able to do it without assistance. On the whole, mine went really well.']
['Nurses were monitoring me as I woke up. I first started waking up as they wheeled me to recovery and started coughing because I was sore from intubation. I was still really sleepy, so fell back asleep in recovery for a while. Eventually woke up again and asked for a popsicle to soothe my throat. They moved me to a chair so I could eat it and have some water. I was up walking and trying to use the bathroom shortly after. It was a day surgery, so they made me pee before they‚Äôd let me go home. ']
["Luckily, the first floor of my home has a bathroom and the kitchen, so I didn't use stairs at all except to get into and out of my home. For the first week, I needed to hold on the railing and a relative's hand because I was so shaky and foggy. I honestly barely left my house for two solid weeks, so I didn't use the stairs at that time; not even to upstairs to my Mom's room or to the basement for any reason."]
["GasX will be your best friend for a couple of days! The gas they pump in you takes a couple of days to subside. Taking GasX helps it to go away faster. Also, moving around helps your body absorb the gas as well. As much as it may hurt or be uncomfortable, moving around and standing up to walk will be really good for your body after what it's went through. "]
['My biggest advice is to take it extremely easy, even if you‚Äôre feeling good. I was feeling great from the hospital drugs and kept walking around and laying on my side and stuff and it really hurt me the day after. I‚Äôm almost 48 hours post-op and in a lot of pain. As long as you take it easy, you should be alright. Don‚Äôt overdo anything and ask for help if you need it!']
['The first two days I mostly had pain from the gas and couldn‚Äôt stay upright for long or I‚Äôd get nauseous/dizzy. My mom did everything for me, I stayed in bed while she brought food to me etc. Moving around was a lot of work and tiring. By the third day the gas was gone and I was walking around, my mom and I even went out to get some things for my apartment. ']
['Honestly I was in more pain before I went into surgery than I was when I came out, but apparently in my anesthesia haze I told the recovery nurse I was in pain, so she gave me a pretty strong cocktail of pain meds. The gas pains were FAR worse than any pain I had from surgery. I took Vicodin mostly for that the first day, and then went to ibuprofen because the Vicodin made me feel like I was going to faint. Not fun!']
["It really wasn't bad at all. The worse pain for me was the shoulder pain, but that went away after day 2. I felt so much better than before the surgery. I only took ibuprofen for the first day for the pain. My surgery was on a Friday and I was back to work by Thursday. I did take it slow at work that Thursday and Friday, but then I was fine. This was my first surgery besides my wisdom teeth, and I was totally nervous too."]


['Quadrupling up on the six week mark being my point for being able to move around more comfortably. I did go out and walk almost every day post op, but it was at the speed of a turtle and required rest and recovery time afterwards.']
['By Day 7, I felt pretty okay. I‚Äôd taken off two weeks and basically I‚Äôd do whatever I felt like for a few hours, lie down for an hour, repeat. I set an alarm to remind myself to lie down just because if I didn‚Äôt, all of a sudden I‚Äôd hurt.']
['It ended up going really well! It was like I blinked and woke up. The healing process wasn‚Äôt too bad; I was pretty drugged the first few days so honestly I don‚Äôt remember much other than being super nauseous once I got home. ']
["Make sure the car seat can lean back so maybe you can take a nap during the drive :) be sure to empty your bladder before the ride  you won't want to stop at a gas station to pee. "]
['I couldn‚Äôt walk for the first week, and was doubled over for about 12 days. By the start of week 3, I could walk for short distances like the car to the office. I had the surgery on a Wednesday, and went back to work on the third Monday. ']
['I was super uncomfortable the first 3 days after my lap. I needed assistant every time I got off the couch and laid back down. In my experience, I wouldn‚Äôt go to the dance. You need to allow yourself to recover properly ‚ù§Ô∏è']
['As it was more complicated I had to stay in hospital overnight even though I got my lap done in the morning. I was feeling really really sick when I woke up and lying down helped. I am like you and am really scared of being sick so I never tried to sit up. The nurse in the evening pushed me to sit up, I ended up being sick and feeling so much better after. Each time I got up, it got better and better. ']
["The pain from the gas trapped in your body won't be fun. As much as it hurts to move, moving is the only way to get rid of it. Get up and walk around, even just around your home. It's gonna suck, but force yourself to do it."]
['You‚Äôre going to do great! Make sure to take it easy after the surgery. Bring a pillow for the ride home that you can hold against your abdomen. It will help with all the jostling in the car. Also be sure to stay on top of your pain meds.']
['Take it easy the next few days. Even if you feel fine. I got up the next day and was walking around and doing stuff as normal then cried myself to sleep at night because the pain hit later. ']


['Get yourself a wedge pillow to sleep elevated and take gas-x a couple times a day. I found it super comfortable to sleep like that with a pillow under each arm and my knees.']
['\nI just figured I was bloated because they moved my insides around (they ‚Äústraightened‚Äù my parts that had moved because of the endo) and because, you know, surgery. I can‚Äôt say if I should have done something about it or if it was normal, but mine went away after about 6 or 7 weeks!']
["Yep. That's totally normal. I'm 3 weeks out and I'm still feeling wiped out halfway through a normal shift at work. Your body has a lot of healing to do and it can take a lot out of you."]
['Surprise during the procedure, probably the "loose" feeling I mentioned. Whenever I went down the stairs I felt the need to hold my tummy so that it didn\'t feel like my insides were sloshing about.']
["5. I'm a side sleeper, but I slept on my back (easier said than done) for about 2 weeks. And even then I was very careful and held my tummy whenever rolling onto my side."]
['I tried to walk mainly all day and tried not to take too long of naps during the day, even though that was really hard. I stopped using my phone and having the tv on 1 hour before I went to bed and that kinda helped. I was still peeing a lot by day 2 but at least it didn‚Äôt hurt as much as day 1. ']
['Take it easy and remember that even when you start feeling much better that your body still has lots of internal healing to do. It‚Äôs very easy to overdo it. Don‚Äôt be discouraged if you feel fatigued more easily after small or normal tasks. Even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like it, your body is going through a lot. ']
['Yeah, I think it was part of the sedation. But I mentioned it because it‚Äôs probably safe to take the day of if they give it as part of the sedation. For my first lap they gave it to me 15 minutes before I left the waiting area, so it definitely wasn‚Äôt to make the waiting easier, but it wasn‚Äôt in the operating room. ']
['As far as going under anesthesia they make you count down from 10 and you are out before you can even finish. Painless and easy. A nurse and will be there by your side when you do wake up. There is some pain for the next couple weeks (first few days are the worst), but nothing some pain meds and a good caretaker can‚Äôt fix. Line up some good movies and shows to watch those first few days and you‚Äôll also be sleeping a lot. Walk around when you can. Wishing you a great surgery and easy recovery!']
['Stairs: I managed the necessary two flights getting home and into bed after surgery, but it was very difficult and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd have made it if I hadn‚Äôt still been drugged up. The one flight down to the kitchen was too much for the first few days. Just getting on and off the toilet was really hard the first few days - wasn‚Äôt expecting that. Pretty much, plan to not be able to use your abdominal muscles much for 2-5 days. It gets better after that.']




Topic 9 OBGYN and endo specialist
doctor specialist find see excision doctors one endometriosis good need symptoms second opinion surgeon help best want lap treatment may diagnosis even think another definitely

["I don't know whether you already have a diagnosis of endometriosis, but I personally wouldn't have a laparoscopy with an obstetrician as this is not their area of expertise and they may not be qualified to accurately identify endometriosis or perform complex excision surgery if necessary. I know you didn't ask about this, but please consider whether this is the best possible surgeon available to you before agreeing to surgery. It seems to be fairly common for people with endo who have surgery with non-endometriosis specialists to need to have repeat surgery again not long afterwards."]
['I wanted to make sure you are well informed. An ultrasound is a good place to start, because it can rule out and diagnose issues other than endometriosis. That being said, the *only definitive way* to diagnose or rule out endometriosis is with a laparoscopic diagnostic surgery/biopsy. If this doctor tells you anything otherwise, go get another opinion. Again, *endometriosis cannot be diagnosed or ruled out without surgery*. ']
['Are you being seen at a BSGE specialist endometriosis centre? If not, you might want to consider going to one to get the best possible surgical recommendations. As you have documented DIE you should have no trouble getting referred. If you do want to have surgery at some point then it would be highly advisable for you to go to one of these centres as it sounds like it is a complex excision and needs a highly skilled surgical team.']
['If the doctor agrees with your suspicions of endo on the bowel, then I strongly advise that you request to be referred on to a BSGE accredited specialist endo centre. This will mean that you can be sure that you will have a necessarily skilled surgical team, including a specialist bowel surgeon and endo excision expert. Specialist scanning is also available at these centres, but may not always be available elsewhere.']
['If your doctor isn‚Äôt an endometriosis specialist, I would recommend getting a second opinion from one. I‚Äôm not recommending this to say surgery is the only choice, but it would be better to be seen by a doctor who knows endometriosis (your doctor doesn‚Äôt sound like they do) and can give you better advice. Also if you‚Äôre going to have a diagnostic lap it‚Äôs better it is done by an excision specialist who can remove any endo at the same time they find it. ']
["I also note you're seeing OBGYNs for treatment - are they specialised in endometriosis treatment? It's possible that they're not specialised enough to adequately treat you. There's a worldwide map of trusted and true endo specialists and surgeons that might be good to check out. Endo is such a complex condition I wouldn't even bother dealing with someone that's not an absolute expert in the field."]
["Ask your gp to recommend a obgyn. They will probably tell you the same thing, the only way to diagnosis endo is through an exploritive laprascopy. So ask them to treat your pain and symptoms. I was fortunate to have a doctor offer that to me. If they don't want to treat you, ask them to say why in your medical files and go see a different doctor. This is a long and frustrating road but you will find a doctor that listens."]
["Some doctors are more likely to say yes to a referral for a consultation with a doc that specializes in endo than they are to say yes if you just straight push for a laproscopy. A specialist would be the best person to evaluate your symptoms, and especially if endo is likely, they're going to recommend a diagnostic laproscopy anyway, which you're going to want to be done by a specialist, anyway. "]
["If you haven't checked out our Successful Doctor's Map in the sidebar, I'd recommend it. It could be a good idea to seek out a second opinion with an endo specialist who has excision experience (those marked with a heart). If nothing else, a second opinion may present different options for treatment than your current doctor is aware of. "]
["Most of all I'm so sorry you're going through this. Your pain is real. Your pain is important. Your pain is treatable. You are deserving of care and relief.  We always recommend that patients try to see endo specialists or excision specialists when possible. We have a Successful Doctors map on the right sidebar, maybe check there if you're looking for a doc? Excision docs are marked with hearts."]


["There are also pain clinics that specialize in pain management, but not all of them treat endometriosis.  You'll have to call around and find one that does, and some require a doctor's referral.  You should definitely start at your primary care physician or gynecologist, whoever treats your endometriosis.  "]
['Hi and welcome to the sub. I am in London like you and we are very lucky that this means we have access to specialist ultrasound and doctors who are probably the world‚Äôs top experts in gyn ultrasound. (I am guessing you saw Mr Jurkovic or someone who trained under him like Mr Holland?).']
['It is much better to see a doctor specialising in abnormal gynaecology if you have a gynaecological disease. For people who live in areas where they don‚Äôt have access to specific endometriosis specialists, the best option is often Gyn oncologists.']
['His first-line diagnostic tool is ultrasound. With skill and experience, you can find endometriosis on ultrasound scans. Not many doctors are trained to do this which is why ultrasound is not the best tool to diagnose endometriosis. It all depends on the doctor.']
["I know it's a frustrating process - we've all been there. But if you haven't seen an endo specialist, I would definitely encourage you to do so! Check out the doctor's map in our sidebar and look for those marked by hearts near you. They will have the best surgical approaches that can really help with managing this disease."]
['I agree with other posters that it might be worth getting a second opinion. Did the doctor take photos or video during surgery? You could potentially avoid another surgery if you can show those to a different doctor (who hopefully has more experience with endometriosis). ']
["I'd also recommend seeing if you can get to a specialist for a second opinion before deciding what to do for treatment. Our Successful Doctor's Map has area endo specialists marked with stars, and those who practice surgical excision (best at removing endo) marked as hearts. "]
["Even if your current docs are lap-shy, I strongly suggest you **push to be referred to a specialist in endometriosis**. It might be easier to convince them to let you talk to a specialist about your symptoms with the argument that a you want to see what a endo specialist thinks about it and/or that a specialist in endometrioisis would be the best person to decide if a lap is merited. But once you get into a specialists office, I'de frankly just ask them directly for a lap. I mean, with your symptoms, I think any endo specialist would highly suspect endo. You have many symptoms (tender/inflamed pelvic pain that can be brought on by urination or intercourse) that are indicative of endo. "]
['Endometriosis can‚Äôt be diagnosed by ultrasound and is likely to return a clear result, especially if it‚Äôs not done by a trained specialist who knows what to look for. I know it‚Äôs really hard work when doctors won‚Äôt take you seriously but try and push for a diagnostic laparoscopy if you can. It‚Äôs the only way to definitively diagnose endo. Is there any of finding another doctor to treat you too? One who might take things more seriously?']
['I would definitely advise getting a second opinion if possible and also seeing a neurosurgeon if you haven‚Äôt already. There are a few neurosurgeons who specialise in endo, but to see one you are likely to have to travel (possibly to other countries) and this may be very expensive.']


["I'd recommend looking at our Doctor's Map in the sidebar, and finding one marked by a heart. Those are endo specialists who do excision well. They'll be your best bet on talking out what options might be best for you."]
["Endo symptoms can vary a lot from person to person. Based on your symptoms I'd say it's def worth getting checked out again! Ideally with a specialist or at least a doctor who knows a lot about endo."]
['A specialist is likely to want to reach a formal diagnosis and if this can‚Äôt be done via ultrasound (ultrasound can diagnose endometriosis in some specific cases but can‚Äòt rule it out) then they are likely to discuss the option of surgery.']
["I would definitely suggest getting to a specialist. Take a look at the Successful Doctor's Map in the sidebar. Try to find one that's marked by a heart if you can, stars will also be good to talk to."]
['Are you being seen at a specialist endometriosis centre? If not I recommend that you ask your GP to refer you to one. This is likely to offer the best level of care. There may however be some wait to be seen at one.']
["If you have not had luck with the doctor, call his office and tell them your symptoms, what you are concerned about, and what you want to rule out. If they don't take it seriously, then ask them for a referral to another doctor or find one through your insurance."]
['However since it could be a lot of things, you can also start with a general doctor, who will hopefully refer you to another doctor. Gyno, surgeon, etc, depending on what they think it might be. ']
["\nI don't disagree with finding a different doctor though your doctor didn't help you really understand why he just seemed to write off the possibility because of how young you are. You need someone who believes your pain. Try and get referred to an endo specialist."]
['Bring up endo to an OBGYN. Keep trying, find a specialist in your area and go to them, research endometriosis specialists where you are and bring your concerns to them directly. If you don‚Äôt have endo, they will still be very sympathetic and help you figure out what‚Äôs going on. ']
["While I understand your gyno is nice and you don't want to switch surgeons, if you can - you should. You don't need a gyno that's sympathetic and understanding - an endo specialist will be that *and* be able to properly treat your endometriosis. Which, at 5 surgeries, your gyno clearly can not do. "]

Topic 11 medical story
years told doctor said got went diagnosed back lap finally first year endometriosis ago found last months since one symptoms ultrasound gyno time see appointment

["I've had symptoms since I was 17. The first doctor I went to about my flare up immediately said he thought it was endo but that I was too young for the surgery to diagnose, and then he retired about a year later. Since then I've had nothing but dismissive doctors (seeing a new gyn every year/every other year since) until 2 months ago when I found one that took me seriously and got my lap done within 2 weeks of my first appt with them. (I'm 30 years old now)"]
["Got similar BS a couple years ago trying to get a lap scheduled. I was in the office for an appointment and the doctor said she would schedule my appointment with a surgeon the next day. I called after a week, it hadn't been scheduled. I kept calling every week or so for a month before they finally scheduled me."]
['I‚Äôve fought and fought and fought with doctors, until I finally got a referral to an endometriosis clinic after my first 4 referrals to the clinic were denied (due to my last surgeon saying I only have mild endo). They finally took me on because I pushed! I got surgery from a endometriosis specialist last July, and.....I‚Äôm still in so much pain. ']
['I had an ultrasound in August and was expecting another ovarian cyst, but the ultrasound showed nothing. I was on the verge of tears when we were going over the results. It‚Äôs so frustrating when you know something is wrong but don‚Äôt have any answers. Before I left my doctor reassured me that she believed my pain was real, and that meant everything to me in that moment.']
['I waited 9 months just to see a gynaecologist‚Ä¶. After speaking to my GP. I rang last Oct, got an appointment in June, which was cancelled then it was moved to July‚Ä¶. Gynaecologist wanted to brush it off for ibs‚Ä¶ but promised me a follow up appt like yours in 3 months (which I had to chase for myself after my private visit) ']
['My mom‚Äôs doctor suspects she has endometriosis, but she‚Äôs never had surgery to get it properly diagnosed. They can tell through ultrasounds she has very large cysts and she‚Äôs also has been having terrible periods since her teens. My aunt apparently had cysts for many years, but was never diagnosed with endometriosis officially either. ']
['I was finally referred to a gynaecologist after my gp realised she couldn‚Äôt do anymore. \nHe listened to everything i said, is pretty convinced I have endo. He‚Äôs arranged an MRI for next week and then we‚Äôre discussing a laparoscopy within the next 6 months. \nSo positive and finally feeling a little hopeful about all of this.']
['After being gaslighted by my OBGYN, I found a new doctor who specializes in Endometriosis diagnosis and treatment. When I sat with him last Wednesday, he listened to every word, wrote everything down, and told me exactly what I believe: ‚ÄúYou have textbook endometriosis symptoms.‚Äù My mom had endo and a hysterectomy at 26. I‚Äôm now 28. ']
['I finally got my scan results back after they got lost but they‚Äôve come back completely normal. \nThe woman doing the ultrasound decided not to do a transvaginal scan, ignoring my gp, because she saw everything she needed but the scan has come back normal. ']
['Background about me. I was on birth control for 11 years until my husband and I mutually agreed that I would go off in 2018. Fast forward to early 2020 and I started feeling pain when going #2, that was my only symptom. I got a pelvic and abdominal ultrasound and a 6cm endometrioma was found and a request was put in for an MRI. ']


['\nLast time I had some bad (not this bad)  pelvic pain my doctor sent me for an internal ultrasound,  and nothing came of it. And in the past I have gone to the ER for a ovarian cyst that burst but when I went they did not believe my pain and sent me home without doing anything, other than booking me for an internal ultrasound the next day (which is when they discovered they I had a cyst burst). ']
["I never had an MRI so I can't say for sure, but I did have an ultrasound that found exactly nothing.  I kept pushing because I knew my symptoms were not just in my head, and eventually they found and removed the endo in a laparoscopy."]
['After more than 20 years of pain, 5 years of infertility, and many dismissive doctors, I finally had my first lap today. They found endo and treated it. I am not crazy. It‚Äôs not all in my head. I cried when the surgeon told me. ']
['After so many years of being told I just had "regular period pain", and seeing mum get just as upset and frustrated as I was (due to constant doctor visits about the same damn pain), can kind of sympathise with you on this one.']
['I had a colonoscopy about a year and a half ago that showed nothing unusual and was diagnosed with IBS instead. About 3 months ago I had an external pelvic ultrasound that, again, showed nothing.']
["I have a history of ovarian cysts, but was going really well for several years. About a year ago, I started having suspicious pain and symptoms, but felt overwhelmed with trying to figure out what's going on."]
['Today I had a in-depth ultrasound scan to check for adenomyosis, I‚Äôve already been diagnosed with endometriosis (3 laparoscopies since September 2018) The pain from this was excruciating. The technician kept apologising over and over for the pain she was causing. ']
['Yeah, I‚Äôve got an ultrasound scheduled with my doctor in 3 weeks to look for cysts and to talk about scheduling a lap...yesterday I was only able to see the NP so she couldn‚Äôt do anything']
['I was just curious as to how many of us have had this same problem. I found it extremely frustrating/degrading to be labelled as such, when I KNEW I had something going on and I almost wanted to go back to them after my first surgery and say "See! I told you!"']
['The doctor claimed my pain was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and my other symptoms that align with possibly endometriosis and PCOS is all ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I started crying because I was so fed up. I feel like all of these appointments are a waste of time! ']


['I recently made an appointment with an endo specialist for September (earliest she could see me) after my regular gyno dismissed me again, and she ordered an MRI in the meantime. ']
["I've had 2 cysts, 1 lap, been diagnosed, and I'm getting scheduled for my second lap. No cysts this time on the ultrasound though so I'm nervous that they'll find nothing. "]
['When I was in the UK i went to the doctors sooo many times complaining about my periods and pain and so many other symptoms I had no idea were endo related. I was fobbed off for nearly 5 years.']
['I was diagnosed 2 years ago and in the past 9 years (including post diagnosis) I have been referred to A&amp;E 10 times for suspected appendicitis (it has never been appendicitis). ']
["I'm trying, I've told 2 doctors now I want that, and neither of them will do it, or refer me to someone who will. I've got an appointment with a 3rd soon and I'm hopeful that they'll listen to what I want."]
['One surgery cancelled my gynae appointment 8 times. They found this in my scans in March 2019, they have now lost those. Only NOW am I getting managed from an 18 month old referral. ']
["So after 20 years of dealing with crippling cramps/nausea/migraines/etc I finally talked to a doctor and scheduled an appointment to get tested. They're doing an ultrasound AND biopsy next week.......and I'm scared."]
["I didn't know about it until this year when I started seeing a new OBGYN. She immediately ordered a new ultrasound and I was clear this time, so I guess it went away on its own? "]
['I was just diagnosed this year, and I\'m 29...I\'m not officially diagnosed either, my doctor told me "well, you either have it or are just really unlucky and have really bad \'insert symptoms list here\'"']
['I feel this. I only got taken seriously (after a loooong time) because my sister was already diagnosed. My sister was only diagnosed because she had a c-section and the doctors saw it then. ']




Topic 12 fertility
pregnant want kids years hysterectomy fertility pregnancy trying one children baby even life ivf still year time never getting told got since child able conceive

["I don't mean to be reckless with my comment.  Like I'm not saying all 18 year olds should go out and get pregnant. But equally I think a lot of us wait until late twenties or thirties now. We want to be married, we want to have the gorgeous house, and we want to be doing well in our careers before we even entertain having children nowadays. \nAnd honestly that's what I regret. I didn't need to wait all those years to be in the perfect scenario to have children. I could have had children much younger (at 23) and I'd have still had everything I needed to raise a child."]
["The kids are mine.  I'm guessing this is related to endometriosis and infertility.  I have encouraging news for people with endo.  I have three beautiful children: 8(boy), 5(girl), 4(boy).  I had NO problems getting pregnant.  When we were trying for our daughter, I miscarried twins at 12 weeks, which was really hard, then had another miscarriage after that at about 6 weeks.  Then I carried her to term.  I have had a couple of other early miscarriages over the years and even got pregnant on BC pills (ending in miscarriage).  But even with the miscarriages I got pregnant really fast.  Other than dealing with preterm labor and having our youngest at 36 weeks, I had beautiful, healthy babies.  "]
["We had not gotten married with the goal of having children and then had changed our minds almost a decade into our marriage. The reality is that children still weren't an important goal for either of us individually nor as a couple, so it was easy to re-establish that we didn't want children and that even if we did we would be 100% fine with other options such as adoption or fostering children in need. "]
["The way to get through it is to look ahead to the next cycle. Start invesitgating natural cycle (in case something about stim drugs harms your egg quality, and besides, it save a shit ton on drugs you don't even respond to), start looking ahead to gamete donation. Avoid thinking about this cycle."]
['My husband is getting his vasectomy reversed in October and we will be trying for baby #2 ASAP. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs not difficult to become pregnant again, and I got pregnant with my first right away even with having undiagnosed endometriosis. I don‚Äôt believe my fertility will be affected the second time, but I guess I will cross that bridge when I get there. ']
["Endo has taken so much from me all through the years! My husband is the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I realized I want to be happy with what I was lucky enough to have in my life already. I decided that I wasn't going to risk my cancer spreading, and losing my future with my husband.  So I'll be asking my doctor for a full hysterectomy. "]
["Several factors together, biggest being cost, but other than that, very low AMH (egg reserve), high FSH factor in to make IVF not really an option. I also lost a fallopian tube due to Endo. I have very few fertility options at this point that I can even afford to try, if they'd even be successful."]
['I really wish I could get a hysterectomy. It would solve so many problems for me. But, I am afraid that I would regret it later in life if I got it done, especially if I don‚Äôt have kids. I know that‚Äôs a messed up way of thinking about it, but I am hoping to have kids someday. I‚Äôve told my boyfriend that when we‚Äôre done having kids I‚Äôd get it done, and he was okay with that.']
["It's obviously your decision. I know women with one ovary have about a 70% chance of conceiving naturally. I understand I'll probably have a difficult time getting pregnant, but I was suffering so badly. Of course I want to have kids one day but my health and sanity were more important to me than any future babies."]
['I have read that it‚Äôs best to TTC within 6 months of surgery. Another doctor told us that‚Äôs it‚Äôs optimal to do it within a year of surgery. She said to avoid waiting until late 20s / early 30s to avoid coupling an Endo diagnosis with age related fertility decline. ']


["Also, just want to throw out there that hystorectomies don't cure endometriosis. In fact over 2/3's of women who have one, still have endo and still have pain. So part of their hesitation is that it isn't a fix, and it's a permanent life changing thing."]
["My mother had two kids with early set Endometriosis. Sadly, it got passed on to me and I won't be lucky enough to (my uterus had too much damage) but it IS POSSIBLE! And LOTS of women have."]
['Hi everyone, I‚Äôm 26 with stage 4 endometriosis and I‚Äôm going to freeze my eggs in January to try and give me an option for IVF in the future due to my endometriosis and my partner having low sperm motility. ']
["While she's lucky she has no pain what so ever and still is fertile and will just need medical help to get pregnant. Cause you know, just cause your tubes are blocked, doesn't mean your uterus can't keep a pregnancy with help of implantation."]
['Exactly! I don‚Äôt even know if the surgery will have any affect on my fertility, much less a positive one- I‚Äôve given my doctor permission to remove an ovary/tube if necessary. I‚Äôd like to try to preserve some fertility but that‚Äôs not the point of the surgery']
["I know multiple women who've gone through this just over a tubal. One has just had her 6th miscarriage at 22, was in the ER and hemmoraghed so much she nearly died. She wanted her tubes tied so that it didn't happen again, and they told her no, you're too young and don't have any kids yet, we can't."]
['Infertility wise, it is true that endometriosis can have an impact on many women‚Äôs fertility. It is also true that many women with endometriosis are able to conceive, whether totally naturally or with assistance. \n']
["\nThe doctor said I'd have try now for a kid or I'd have a 0% chance by 30. My husband (boyfriend at the time) wasn't ready to be a dad, but I did IVF treatment against his wishes. He's still upset about it. I tried all I could and treatments failed. I had a couple of eggs at 26, but now at 30 I have 0. I have premature ovarian failure. I've been told it could be from starting my period young."]
['If fertility is at all important to you, that is another reason to consider getting a diagnosis and excision. I‚Äôve had both of my Fallopian tubes removed as they were destroyed by endo and I maybe should have had one of my ovaries removed too but I begged my surgeon to let me keep both if possible to increase my IVF chances. I may never be able to get pregnant because of the delay in diagnosis/treatment. ']
['I already have 3 step daughters so I would be okay with not having any biological children.  I think I have already accepted that my chances of carrying a pregnancy to term are pretty slim if I did keep my uterus. ']


['Stage three, I had also had a tubal ectopic pregnancy (NOT a planned pregnancy) about two years before we conceived my so  I was also working with only one working fallopian tube']
["I'm the same age as you and I also have pretty severe endo...and personally I'd go for the lap. You haven't had one yet, so maybe it would give you more time than you think pain-free, or at least with reduced pain."]
['Your doctor has no idea what will happen to your fertility. Most women who have endometriosis are able to ultimately go on to get pregnant and have a healthy pregnancy/birth (some do need assistance like IVF, but many do not).']
["When my oldest step-sister said that she was going to have her tubes tied my mum told her not to do it, because you just never know where life will take you and you don't know what you might want in 5 or 10 years."]
['Basically, I don‚Äôt want to like get your hopes up but also all hope isn‚Äôt lost. I think if being pregnant is a huge life goal it isn‚Äôt selfish to try to achieve it. ']
['For me, I always thought I‚Äôd just adopt because I figured I was infertile. Now that I know I‚Äôm not able to have a kid, I‚Äôm thinking about being child free even though I had originally thought I would adopt.']
['I understand that since I am so young my concern of being able to have my tiny family shouldn‚Äôt be there but it might be the only chance I get before I might have to get my partial hysterectomy and it‚Äôs been on my mind heavily.']
["I got pregnant on my second cycle both times. However, I will note that I was diagnosed with endo shortly after my second pregnancy, although I'd had the symptoms for years before I had kids."]
["It's been 2 1/2 half years since the hysterectomy and I haven't had any pain issues yet. I still have both ovaries so there is a chance the endo can come back, but we'll cross that bridge if we get to it."]
["I can't conceive naturally, and it's very likely that I can't conceive through fertility treatments. My husband and I agreed that we won't be trying for biological children, ever, for multiple reasons."]




Topic 13 insurance
insurance medical health hospital work care pay need doctor live one see doctors money time private even cover job able cost state could system people

['Another option would be to find a company that offers insurance to part time workers (like Starbucks) and get a temporary part time job to get the surgery covered. If that‚Äôs not an option you should look into state coverage. I‚Äôm not sure what you current reason for not having insurance is but I believe each state offers insurance for low income/unemployed/disabled individuals etc at a reasonable or even free cost depending on your situation. ']
['I‚Äôd call both your insurance company as well as the hospital. Ask your insurance company if their contract for this hospital allows this prepay scenario (sometimes this is included in provider contracts, sometimes it isn‚Äôt.) I‚Äôd also call the hospital and ask if you can work out a payment plan. You could also ask your surgeon if they have privileges at another hospital. (This is on the hospital, not your insurance company.)']
['This isn‚Äôt true, you absolutely have the right to choose which doctors you are treated by and within which hospitals. If you are resident in England and under NHS England you have specific rights to choice outlined in the NHS constitution. The process is sometimes a little different if you are in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, but you should still be able to choose your doctors, hospitals and treatment.']
["If you want to be in a research study you don't necessarily even need health insurance. I used to work in clinical research and we had patients that had no health insurance at all participate in our trials specifically because they couldn't afford treatment on their own. I would reach out directly to the clinical research coordinator listed for the study you're interested in and see if you can qualify. "]
["If you don't have private health insurance your GP refers you to a hospital and you are given a category that determines your wait time. I believe for endo it's about a year. You see the surgeon you're assigned to. No choices, but its free. Well, we all pay for our Healthcare system via taxes, but very few out of pocket expenses for public system use."]
['* We are fairly new to insurance terminology, am I correct in my understanding that   the "max out-of-pocket costs for out of network" in our case refers to the maximum annual amount, deductables and co-pay we will be charged?  example:  If the deductable for a surgery out of network with approval is 5k, the total surgery is 35k, and the max-out-of-pocket is 11k with a 50% coinsurance factor, that we would pay the 5k deductable, the remaining 30k would be be covered 50% by the insurance coverage and 50% but us 15k a piece, but 5k+15 is 20k and our out-of-pocket max is 11, that we would be responsible for 11k?  Any and all help here would be greatly appreciated.']
["The majority of hospitals have community care programs that offer assistance on bills, and some even cover everything insurance doesn't cover. If for some reason you can't apply for that I would look for Free women's clinic's in your area or even check out Planned Parenthood they might be able to help out."]
["Money is a factor for sure.  Between being a single income household, and her rising medical cost it's tough to plan/spend and save.  I could write for hours on the American health care system.  I won't.  Hopefully some long term support is in the future- but with all federal services, who knows.  "]
["I'm in the process of getting quotes too, for the surgeon only fees in Sydney one place quoted me between $2500-$7500 but couldn't tell me where in that range, and another quote was $4500. Then the anethetist fees and the hospital fee were on top of that. I have private health insurance which would cover some of the cost but I believe Medicare also covers a portion of it."]
['Contact medical records and ask for a copy of your surgical report and your medical file. You may have to go to the office in person to sign a consent form but once you make the request, legally they have to give you access to your medical records and they you will have copies of the picture and the surgical notes to review.']

["Definitely call your insurance company first. I considered seeing one of the Orbuchs in NYC but decided against it after looking into how my insurance plan works. My plan has a huge separate out-of-network deductible that made it unaffordable for me, so calling and getting some basic info about your plan could give you an idea of whether it's a feasible option for you."]

['Totally understandable! You can always call the hospital or chat with your insurance company to get a quote. I discovered my hospital had someone on staff whose job was to do just that, provide quotes for final costs. I also have BCBS and was able to do an estimator online with my surgeon for final costs based on my plan. I discussed what I would have to pay out of pocket with someone on their chat option too, just to be safe. It‚Äôs kind of annoying to figure that stuff out but can give you a huge piece of mind. And what‚Äôs amazing is they ended up covering MORE than what I was originally quoted!']
["Without...probably anywhere from $10-20k (and if you're looking at doing this without insurance and you're in Georgia, consulting with the CEC may be worth your time - they offer a free review of medical records and let you know how much it will cost before surgery....the hospital, anesthesia, etc, may be in-network, but the CEC surgeons are all out of network so they can do what they need to do once they're inside - they're not at the will of insurance)."]
['I have the opportunity to seek treatment at the Center for Endometriosis Care in Atlanta. Even with my insurance the quote I have to pay up front is $8,500. Does anyone have any advice on how to afford it or if there is any assistance for those with endo seeking treatment? ']
['If I could I would probably consider it, but I am stuck in Texas for good, and they have the cheapest med schools in the US. Plus, I‚Äôm bound by a contract I had to sign when I deferred that I‚Äôm not allowed to apply for any other med schools.']
['Availability can also be a problem depending on where you live (Scotland, Wales and the very North of England seem to have much less coverage and if you live in those areas you may have to travel to see a specialist).']


['You‚Äôll have to call the insurance company and make sure that all the doctors involved are in network. You should also check to see how much it would take to meet your deductible. My surgery was almost $30,000 but with my insurance (BlueCrossBlueShield) I only paid like $1,000. Some people have done better and didn‚Äôt have to pay anything believe it or not. It all really just depends on your insurance and what they say. Good luck!']
["If you're incredibly broke, your local hospital may have a charity/financial assistance program? I work for a doctor's office owned by a hospital system and a lot of our patients are on an assistance program. This usually means their bills are completely written off by the hospital or they get things at a discount. It may be worth looking into?"]
["Depending on what insurance you have, you might be able to find the pricing estimate on their website. Every medical provider will have a set contract rate for a particular service with your carrier. On my insurance, I can look up the provider and the service and get an estimate of the fee schedule. Any surgical procedure - like a lap - will have a facility charge, a surgeon's charge, and an anesthesiologist's charge.  You can also try calling the hospital or surgery center for an estimate. Once you have the fees estimated, you can look at your insurance plan benefits and educate what you'll end up paying. Some doctors or hospitals will do this for you and give you an estimate up front."]
['It looks like legally you should be covered but you might have a fight on your hands. This was taken from the website: ‚ÄúTechnically yes, but out-of-state employers and health plans often do not comply with the requirement to include MA-mandated benefits for their employees living or working in MA. There is no active jurisdiction for compliance and the out-of-state employers know that. The MA Division of Insurance has indicated that a resident of MA, regardless of his or her location of employment, is entitled to receive infertility coverage.‚Äù']
['There aren‚Äôt any medical costs at any point. People do have associated costs such as parking fees at hospital for appointments or some hospital wards have pay to use bedside television systems. For low income people these costs may be claimable (eg. You can claim the cost of public transport to a hospital appointment if you have low income). Being British people complain endlessly about needing to pay these things.']

["I have been using OneMedical for the past 5 years for general care. They accept insurance and are in-network, but basically you pay $200/year to be a member so that they don't have to rely 100% on insurance to get paid and therefore can spend more time with patients and offer treatment that doesn't follow the insurance companies' demands. It's a world of difference."]
["Eesh you really shouldn't have to deal with that. I'm from the UK, I've lost count of the times in the past year I've been grateful for the NHS. So our GP appointments, consultant appointments, surgery etc. is all free. We have to pay for prescriptions (¬£9 an item, but you often get Waiting lists are pretty variable and so is getting a referral and what drugs you get prescribed."]
['Another factor to consider is that travel insurance is much more expensive if the US in included (because of potential medical costs) and this is especially true if you want to be covered for a pre-existing condition. If you have medical procedures planned for the trip the additional insurance premium is likely to be substantial.']

["I used to work as an events and line producer, some days I'd be on my feet for 22 hours. I basically got promoted which means I now do a lot more sitting which has made my life easier.

['Edit: I wanted to add that if you go for smoking, there is a difference in strains. Sativa strains are more for being awake and active, whereas Indica strains are more for relaxing and sleeping.

['Typically I dose a 0.5mg  syringe with a 30mg/g cbd and a 27mg/g indica thc about with either a 1:1 or 3:2 ratio for bad to medium pain days. 4:1 on low pain days.  Bad pain days I have taken 3 "doses" in 3 hours, and then mild pain days one dose every 12 hours works for me to not have any pain. ']

It‚Äôs a godsend for sure.']
["When I was in constant pain and didn't want to take pain killers, I would take edibles or smoke weed. I don't know if that's an option for you, but I found edibles to be the most helpful pain reliever. The downside (or upside depending on what you need to do that day) is you get high, so it wasn't ideal for things like work. On days my pain was taking me out of commission, a weed cookie would help more than Vicodin."]
["I tend to find that tramadol is my go to drug for pain, mostly because it makes me feel really drowsy and helps me sleep.  I'm unable to take NSAIDs, so am stuck with paracetamol or tramadol, but if you're able to take any NSAIDs like diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin, maybe in conjunction with paracetamol, you might find effective relief."]
['I agree that CBD is a life saver. Make sure you get cbd not hemp, and if you live in a legal state in the US get something with an equal thc/cbd ratio. The cbd prevents you from getting high and allows the the thc to work medicinally with the cbd. It‚Äôs the only thing that helps with my pain, even opiates don‚Äôt put a dent in it.']


['Have you tried Delta 8? It‚Äôs thc but less potent than regular weed. You can buy it at vape shops legally. At least in my state. The gummies help with my pain.']

["If you live in a place with legal marijuana or medical marijuana it might be worth it to try an indica strain. It's the only thing that truly gives me relief."]
['I am not in PA, but pure CBD products are not psychoactive. I use it and other cannabinoids for help with pain. I have addiction in my family and I am terrified of getting to the point that I need opiates and so far high quality cannabinoid strains that are known to help with pain have been a huge help. My favorite product is from Mary‚Äôs Medicinals called The Formula. It is a blend of mostly non psychoactive cannabinoids (CBG, CBD, CBN) with a very small amount of THC and THCa. I am very sensitive to THC and if I feel high I actually feel more pain and this has absolutely zero high. Pain relief is quick too, my husband times it once and it took 4 minutes. It is expensive but it works really well for me. I don‚Äôt need a medical card where I live, so I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt help you there. Usually you need to talk to your doctor and get a prescription though. ']

I don't even know where to begin or what to say.\nIt's not that I had to take my finals while in pain and on Morphine, or that I had to study for them despite having missed almost half of my classes (and the other half being drowsy / barely focused). It's not that I had to finish term projects, or cook or clean despite just not having the energy..."]
["I buy mine from a local shop my brother works at. I have a 200mg vape pen to use for immediate, short lasting relief and 200mg gummies to use for longer, slower acting relief. I can only take the gummies before bed because they make me very sleepy. I would suggest starting with a small dosage and working up. Also, when you start using CBD do it when you don't have to do anything that day/the day after until you know how it affects you!"]
["Seriously. Its like a godsend. Green strain kratom, small doses throughout the day, and I'm like a normal functioning awake person again. It's legal most places, it's cheap (if you buy it online) and if you're having really bad pain and just want to take it easy you can take red kratom too. "]
['I found for me a CBD tincture helped the most! A higher dosage makes a difference and I think it‚Äôs better to use preemptively (takes a while to notice the pain relief otherwise) I‚Äôm in Canada so our brands might differ depending on where you are but hopefully that gives you a starting point ']
['As an adult, I‚Äôve found topical CBD oil to be a decent remedy. I use one without THC because where I live now it isn‚Äôt legal otherwise, but my friend back home with PCOS swears by a THC one.

["I think the answer is tricky, why shouldn't you get sympathy when you are in so much pain and suffering? Endo isn't fair. You didn't ask for this and you don't want it. It can be alienating and lonely. It makes me personally feel very vulnerable and I absolutely hate feeling that. Sympathy isn't selfish to want I think it is comforting to know somebody out there is trying to understand your pain and hopefully acknowledges your strength. It seems like you are aware of it, and I don't think you should feel guilty for wanting recognition and understanding. "]
['For him, the pain of the lack of intimacy will not go away. For you, the physical torment of endo will not go away. You are overcoming your pain to care about his perspective, which is important in a loving relationship. He needs to learn how to overcome his lesser pain and turn his affection towards supporting you emotionally. Rejecting him is as hard on you as it is on him. As your partner, he really needs to step up his game.

We always have to remind ourselves there is no competition and that pain in a relationship happens for both. Being capable of understanding that is important.

["After surgery last year, I was placed on lupron for six months, I had bleeding for a two months while on lupron, it was shorter than my regular period and not overly painful it lasted for around three days. Afterwards, I was placed on birth control with no breaks for three months (so only active pills for three months). After the three months my period came for the usual five to six days but it  was WAY more painful. That had nothing to do with the lupron, at least I don't it did. "]
['I use the Nuva Ring continuously (I switch it out every 3 weeks) and it‚Äôs been amazing. I‚Äôve been on it for about 18 months. If I start spotting during my cycle, I‚Äôll take it out at the end of my 3 weeks and have a period to ‚Äúreset‚Äù. I‚Äôve had to do that maybe 3 times since I started continuous BC. My periods are still bad but not nearly what they were when I wasn‚Äôt on continuous BC. It‚Äôs also normal for your body to take time to adjust to continuous birth control.']
["I have horrible menorrhagia and anemia so I started taking Natazia quadraphasic pill 3 months ago. I have had awful side effects and constant breakthrough bleeding on all other mono and tri phasic BC pills that I have tried. Natazia was amazing for the 1st month and a half with perfect light periods. I missed 1 pill during the 1st week of the 2nd pack and didn't double up. I had ovulation symptoms and exactly 2 weeks after that incident, I had full on painful period. I'm positive I ovulated and my own hormones took over that pack. The bleeding went on for well over a week and didn't stop until the placebos. Now I also had some ovulation symptoms AGAIN during the placebos and 1st few pills of the 3rd pack (I didn't even miss any and took all at the same time) and like clockwork, 2 weeks from the placebos, I started bleeding halfway through the 3rd pack. I think I am going to stop and restart the pills because I cannot deal with this mayhem. Is my breakthrough ovulation messing this up just because of that 1 PILL! I was doing perfectly fine before that..."]

Before that I was on a pill to stop bleeding all together, except I had my period for the first three months solid... so far on the mirena I've had spotting quite a bit but no actual period yet. So pain from cramping, cycles, etc. has been greatly reduced."]

I had been on birth control pills for several years (actually started taking them well before my endo symptoms ever even started). No improvement after my surgery, so 2 years ago my doc recommended switching from continuous birth control to an IUD. I currently have Kyleena.']
['There are so many combination pills. One combo may work better for you than the other one. The first I tried was Levonorgestrel/EthinylEstradiol and was a nightmare. Then years later I tried two progesterone only options one pill the other the IUD and were even worse. Then another years later from the first pill on Dienogest/EstradiolValerate was amazing for about a year.']

I‚Äôve had some pain and cramping in the few months following my second lap, and my doctor doubled the dose of the depo and has me getting the shot every two months instead of every three. ']
['High estrogen caused me to have daily bleeding for 8 months. It was the worst. Low estrogen wasn‚Äôt much better. I had spotting for six months straight in a low dose. I‚Äôve been taking three progestogen only pills per day for three months now and have only spotted maybe 3 days total.']

["Yes, the pill can do that. I took the pill when I was 16 until 18 and then started again when I was 19 because of acne treatment and stopped again soon after I stopped the treatment.

I had some changes in my periods like flow and duration but it was gradual, so much that it took almost 6 years until I started complaining to my previous doctor."]

I‚Äôve tried many different hormonal treatments, however they have all made me severely depressed to the point of being suicidal. The only one I‚Äôve been able to tolerate has been Estelle 35, but even taking it consistently has not stopped any bleeding.']

These got worse and then I started getting headaches even when I wasn‚Äôt on the pill break. They were just all the time. I tried the 3 packets back to back/4 days break method but it didn‚Äôt help so my doctor switched me onto Gedarel 20/150. This was maybe 2-3 years ago now. I still get a bit of a headache on the break even though I take it 3 packets/4 days but not as badly, although recently I think it‚Äôs been getting worse.']

I then went back on it and had the same occasional period/spotting issues until my current specialist switched me to 5mg Norethindrone (progesterone only) in March of this year. So far it‚Äôs been working really well for me in terms of completely stopping bleeding; I had maybe 1 period and then spotted a little bit at first but haven‚Äôt had any bleeding since June.']
['The Mirena does nothing to retard the growth of endo but it has absolutely helped to mask a lot of my symptoms including;\n- Controlling my my pmdd. My mood has evened out\n- reducing the frequency and severity of migraines that would previously hospitalise me\n- regulate my cycle and eliminate my period. I used to bleed for 6 weeks at a time with only a few days "off" in between periods. I now have one to two days of light spotting 3-4 times a year.']
['The weird part in all of this is since i stopped taking any form of birth control for almost 3 months now my pain is completely gone. My periods came back for Oct/Nov but i didnt get one in Dec or Jan??']


['I was on a combo pill.  Then we added progesterone.  Then progesterone only.  The mirena.  Then Mirena with progesterone.  Then Mirena with the combo pill.  Then all three.  Each had multiple tries.  Continuously.  My period never stopped.']

['I took continuous bc for ten years but about once a year I would get a period that would last for like three weeks. I am now on Orilissa (have been for three weeks) and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm going to have a cycle or not. Birth control did not stop the growth of my endo or the pain.']
['I was on the copper IUD for several years, first after my first birth and then again after my 2nd birth. I had the first in for 1 year and and then after my 2nd birth I had two for their whole life period subsequently. ']
['I started birth control at 14 (Yaz) but I quickly changed brands because I bled every single day on Yaz for a good 6 months. I finished with Ortho Tri-cycle Lo']
["It could be endo. I was put on norethindrone acetate (mini pill) in addition to nexplanon. I was having normal periods on nexplanon for about 1.5 years then all of a sudden started getting periods every 8 days. That's when they added the mini pill and even though it's been over 2 months without a period I still have daily pain from endo (I was diagnosed with a lap back in 2019)."]
['Aged 16-17 my normal periods turned to months apart and heavier, bloodier periods that started and stopped throughout the week.

I always always feel worse the days I don‚Äôt have that. I don‚Äôt digest greens well usually and struggle to eat healthy sometimes. I find it all super easy to digest in a smoothie. In general the less fried foods I eat the better my symptoms are. Also the less refined sugars. I‚Äôve cut dairy and gluten in the past and it helped, but I think the dairy cutting was much more helpful. I still mostly avoid dairy except for cheese sometimes or a little milk in a dish I‚Äôm making.']
['I try to eat mostly dairy and gluten free because it upsets my stomach and bowels, I love lactose free milk and I find that is the most similar to 2% or whole. Gluten free can often be a little harder to find especially if you are picky about texture, it‚Äôs really about trial and error on favorite brands and alternative ingredients. I prefer Bonza noodles, Diya and Lactaid when it comes to brands for both, also sprouted bread is apparently gluten free. I definitely find when I keep my diet clean from those items and other animal products I feel much better overall.']
['I think it‚Äôs pretty personal. For me red meat and dairy are massive triggers, but I can eat pretty much anything else. I do my best not to consume too much soy, because its a plant estrogen, and overall I try to eat healthy - mainly whole grains, veggies, fruit, and small amounts of fish and poultry. I do eat baked goodies like cake and pastries in moderation, but they‚Äôve never caused me to flare up. I just try not to go overboard on them for general health reasons.']
["\nI have tried a few different eating styles (low fodmap, gluten free, low inflammatory) and none have done much for me. I'm really sensitive to caffeine and alcohol so I generally avoid them (or have extremely small quantities), also poultry meats make me feel screwy in the gut but other than those 3 food isn't really a factor. Obviously I do feel better when eating a more balanced diet but fast food doesn't mess with my energy or digestion unless it turns into a daily thing. "]

["* I replaced my milk and yoghurt with lactose free products. Soy milk is also okay if its made from soy protein extract, but not if its made from soy beans.\n* I replaced my normal white bread with traditional sourdough bread. Pproper sourdough doesn't use yeast so it is much lower in fructans.\n* I swapped out my high-fructose fruits for other fruits. I cut out apples, peaches, pears apricots and watermelon and replaced them instead with bananas, rockmelon, oranges, strawberries, grapes, etc.\n* I stopped drinking fruit juice and instead drink cordial or ice tea.\n* I swapped candy with artificial sweeteners for candy with natural ones.\n* Instead of honey in my cooking or porridge, I use golden syrup.\n* I limit my intake of bakery goods that use wheat, and instead primarily buy gluten free baked good. The gluten itself is actually fine. Its just that grains that have gluten and grains that have fructans are the same (wheat, spelt, rye and barley) so other flours like oat, buckwheat, etc are both gluten free and low-FODMaP"]
["Low carb is not a reduction of calorie dense food, rice isn't heavy in calories and potatoes are on a low to moderate scale, for example.  Much of what I replace it with are actually calorifically and nutritionally dense: avocado, nut milks, etc. as opposed to fillers and inflammatory foods. My eating plan sticks to 1,250-1,300 calories a day with a focus on nutrition that is healthiest for my digestion than on counting each and every calorie."]
['Smoothies- go to mix is frozen banana, unsweetened almond milk, frozen fruit (blueberry, mango, cherry, tropical mix w/passionfruit, apple etc), protein powder (I have vegan chocolate, vanilla, and peanut butter), and flax/chia seeds. Sometimes I add in cinnamon, peanut butter, spinach, creatine, beets, carrot juice, honey, yoghurt, cheesecake flavour drops etc ']
['Totally agree with @fur74. And until you get to that surgery try to keep away from inflammatory food and beverages: try to reduce or give up gluten, dairy, red meat, sodas and juice, coffe alcohol. Also try to stay away from soy as it is boosts the estrogen production. And introduce anti-inflammatory foods like Fish, Berries, Grapes, Avocado, Turmeric and Ginger, Green tea etc']
['My top trigger foods are red meat, lemonade, and low quality dairy or dairy in high amounts. I can have grass-fed, organic dairy and be just fine. I also feel better when I eat lots of healthy fats and fiber - blueberries, spinach and chia seeds are soothing foods to me that make me feel better. All of this to say - you just have to figure out what your body needs.']


["Ha well I already never drank alcohol or caffeine and only eat any meat when I crave it. Dairy was always low (cheese and kefir) and I lowered the added sugar a lot. So either it's processed food or my troubles might not be solved by nutrition. "]
['Actually, I already have a food diary, and I list all the calories from each food and drink in the food diary. And I also check out the calorie amounts from each food and drink, and all the calories from the foods and drinks I consume are the desired daily calorie amount every day.  ']

['Add a lot more dark leafy greens like arugula and spinach to your diet, and dandelion root, licorice root and echinacea herbal teas are great for reducing inflammation. I personally recommend yogi and traditional medicinal brands.']
['I have done keto in the past, so I think I should go back to it! It really helped a lot of my problems but I didn‚Äôt really make the connection until just recently. I use xylitol as a sweetener in baking and other things. It‚Äôs perfect for me. The thing about keto though, I‚Äôm vegetarian so it‚Äôs quite restrictive but doable :)']
['Anti-inflammatory diet is very helpful, even if you don‚Äôt have a true allergy. The cleaner the better, but even if you just try and limit gluten and certain types of dairy, it helps. I found that some dairy, like Greek yogurt, my body is fine with, and others it‚Äôs not.']
['I‚Äôve also found that in terms of FODMAP almost none of the fruit stuff bothers me unless I eat a crazy huge quantity, it‚Äôs mostly just the onion/garlic stuff. So you may find you can still eat the fruit you love after the elimination phase']
["- Loosely follow a paleo/primal style wholefoods lifestyle as that's how I feel best. I've tried a few but this is the one that works for me. It's lots of vegetables and good fats, moderate amount of fruits and nuts, small amount of high-quality meats and treats. "]
['Because of the endo on my bowels I am doing a combination of the lowFODmap diet and the endo diet.

So I eat mostly a plant based diet.']
["I've been vegan 16 years, and now due to Endo I've had to cut out soy, gluten, corn, peanuts, beans, nightshades, and caffeine/coffee. I already don't drink alcohol, so that was easy. I've also had to limit sugar (including fruit), nuts and seeds, processed foods, and chocolate."]


["I have endo on my colon, and certain foods, like soy, trigger instant pain for me. I've done well on gluten free, soy free, dairy free and low sugar (I get almost all my sugar from fruits now). I very rarely eat anything that is heavily processed. This is just what seems to help my body. You will need to do some experimenting, maybe do an elimination diet to see what helps you. Good luck!"]
["- Eat organic or chemical-free as much as possible, especially meat and eggs. I almost completely avoid super-processed and preservative-filled packaged foods, especially anything with msg. I try to avoid too much gluten, but I'll choose organic sourdough with gluten over a processed gluten free bread thing, so wholefoods are more impactful to me."]
['I follow my own version of the anti inflammatory diet, or what I personally have found to be an anti inflammatory diet for my body. That means I avoid soy, gluten, non organic meats/eggs/dairy, added sugar, alcohol, caffeine, canola oil, and preservatives/processed foods. I ensure to incorporate enough fiber, veggies, good fats, and protein into my daily diet to keep inflammation down. ']
['As the other person mentioned, being hyper aware of the trigger foods. For me it is any form of take out, eating out at restaurants except for maybe sushi. Premade processed foods as well so no chocolate bars, no cheez its etc. No raw vegetables, mostly super blended and well cooked foods like soup and stew. Minimal caffeine and staying well hydrated. ']
['If you switch to grassfed, organic dairy you might see improvements. Organic grassfed dairy contains less pro-inflammatory fats (omega 6s) than conventional dairy, and even contains more good fats (omega 3s)! I completely switched and now I can enjoy dairy in mass quantities with no negative effects!! (Because sometimes you just need cheese).']
['Now for the inflammatory portion, she has cut out foods known to trigger inflammatory responses ESPECIALLY dairy, wheat, caffeine and soft drinks. She replaces dairy with almond milk and just generally avoids soft drinks and bread anyway. We have replaced wheat as a carbohydrate with potatoes. Now that reduces the chance for systemic inflammation. We then supplement with natural anti inflammatories. 1g evening primrose oil, 1g fish oil, 2000iu vitamin d, and vitamin e along with a good multivitamin daily.']
['* Drink lots of water\n* take refined sugar and sugar free foods and drinks out of your diet as much as you can\n* add nutrition wherever you can.  Try to eat a fresh green vegetable every day\n* eat protein and fiber when you eat carbs\n* check the glycemic index/glycemic load of a food and place more importance on that than carb counts']
["Thanks so much! Yeah, I'm definitely going to be changing my diet. I eat pretty healthily, but I have a lot of gastrointestinal issues, which I'm assuming are linked to endo. Red meat is the hardest on me, so I'm completely cutting that out."]
['Yes, carbonated drinks make me very bloated/gassy. I‚Äôm sure everyone has different levels of sensitivity (or lack of) to it, but for me I do have to hugely limit my fizzy drink intake for comfort (I was a huge seltzer fan before too)']
["Alcohol bothers me and if I drink too much caffeine that does too. But, cutting out caffeine completely didn't help so there does seem to be a threshold with it. besides that, I haven't made much of an effort to figure out if anything else bothers me."]

I‚Äôve brought notepads to doctor‚Äôs appointments with all my questions written down! You got this! To make her your gyno, all you need to do is call the office and schedule an appointment. They will likely ask you what you need to be seen for, and you‚Äôll just list everything you wrote in this post.']
["I'm finally going to see a specialist for all the pain. (It's been a long wait to see this doctor!) But I'm super nervous and still have to remind myself that it's okay to get help and that my pain isn't all just made up. I have a pain journal and a list of questions. Is there something I'm forgetting? Or something you personally recommend? What can I expect from this visit? I guess I am excited but scared and would appreciate hearing from others who have been through this."]
["As for 1 - I would call your doctors office and ask the nurse to get you an answer. Lots of people don't know you can do this. They want to make sure you are doing the treatment right also, so they'll find your answer and call you back to make sure you are on course. I would think you would not do BC, but I've never done it. And you still want to follow your doctor's direction."]
["They pushed it because the anesthesiologist cancelled or something or something happened, I'm not really too sure they just told me there was no anesthesiologist available anymore, it's super frustrating. I was having super bad anxiety before and now I have to wait longer ugh. \nI'm glad you were still able to get your surgery!"]
['That apt was supposed to be today, and gyno  never sent the letter. I had to call the gyno and leave a bunch of  messages asking them to please send my GP the update so we could move  forward with my treatment with all the information. ']
["Not normal but...pandemic.  you can either cancel and find a new doctor or demand to meet him the morning of (you can still walk out if you dont like him!).  If he's not hearing you though, lap or no lap, h isn't going to be helpful."]
['Hey guys, so my first laparoscopy is tomorrow morning and I‚Äôm trying to make sure I‚Äôm ready. Do you have any tips or advice, or questions I need to ask my doctor afterwards? I‚Äôm really nervous that I‚Äôll forget something.']
['Depending on your setup (if you can talk with your surgeon ahead of time), it might be helpful to try to explain your pre-surgery anxiety so that they can make sure to give you some meds as soon as possible to calm you a little.']
['Does this sound similar to any of your experiences or am I totally off base with my thoughts? I am going to discuss with my gyno but I am trying to decide if I should try to set up an appointment soon or if I should just try to wait until my annual exam in November. ']
["Now I have an appointment with my gynaecologist in a few weeks and I'm wondering what questions I should ask my doctors (both my gynaecologist and the surgeon) regarding surgery and stuff. Any ideas are welcome. I made a list already, but there might be some things that I haven't thought of."]


['It‚Äôs something that could return at any point though. If you‚Äôre not sure, call your doctor or the hospital doing the surgery and talk to them? They might understand and be able to explain more about it. Good luck!']
['Right? That‚Äôs what I was thinking but I wasn‚Äôt sure if that was out of line for me to ask or not haha. I‚Äôm thinking I want to call doctor 1 back and tell her about today and just say you know like ....what lol.']
['We can‚Äôt tell you everything is ok as it wouldn‚Äôt be safe for anyone on the Internet to do that. Hopefully nothing serious is happening but if you continue to be worried then a trip to hospital might be sensible.']
["Hey, thanks for replying! I've been doing some more research and I think when I've got time I'll book an appointment with my doctor to see if I can get a referral to a specialist if they think I need it. My main concern is that I won't be able to speak up if they're dismissive, I'm not so great at that kind of stuff, but if I need to I'll try to get someone to come with me. "]
["Hello! First, I'd like to say that I have no idea if I'm allowed to post this type of question here--if not, please let me know where and I'll delete this! But I would very much appreciate any help that can be given to me. "]
["I really need help. I'm in the process of finding a doctor but it's so hard right now that I called in January and got a PHONE CALL appt with a doctor in April!"]
["Thank you, I'm trying to get in to see my doctor today. My GYN suggested I see my GP or another doctor in person today. Hopefully I dont have to go to the ER or anything."]
["Write a list of everything you think you might want to cover during your visit. You may change your mind about some things once you're there, but at least you won't have forgotten!"]
['I think taking in your notes is really the best idea and if you don‚Äôt feel like your doctor is listening to you or taking you seriously, don‚Äôt waste your time with them and find another doctor.']
['I‚Äôm going to a new specialist tomorrow after no improvements from my last surgery. What are good questions to ask the doctor to make sure they‚Äôre a good fit? Thank you!!']


['After some recommendations from your experiences post surgery.\n \nI live alone so need to be ready to come home and not have to worry about anything for a least the first week.']
["I've brought in a notebook that I track my symptoms in, but they never give me a chance to refer to it, or take the time to read it if I do manage to bring it up and give it to them üòî"]
["Thank you so much, I'll definitely be in there with someone! I managed to contact the university hospital rather than the clinic! I'm actually waiting for a phone call from them with an available appointment, so far it's been a week of anxious waiting! Thank you, that's why I tried to get an appointment elsewhere! "]
["Just an update, I called my doctor's office yesterday afternoon and spoke to the nurse about whether or not I need to see my doc about the changes in my symptoms. She said he would probably want to see me and sent him a message, he's hopefully going to call me this morning. "]
['Oh yeah, someone mentioned that once. I‚Äôll look them up and see if I can send in the pictures. I really wish someone could let me know what/if they see anything odd. I really thought I‚Äôd get answers during my lap, but guess I put too much faith into it. Thank you for responding! ']
['Not sure if this is the place to come and ask this question but it‚Äôs worth a start.\nI currently can‚Äôt book a GP appointment as I‚Äôm in the process of registering, but as soon as I can, I‚Äôll be booking but thought it might be useful to come here first, since this seems a good knowledge base.']
['This is my chance to really ask questions to the doctor and get some great insight.  The issue is I am just not sure to ask so I wanted to see if anyone has been in a similar situation and had questions you wished you asked or had something you wish you said at the time.  Any input helps.  Thanks!']
['A. Know what you want going in that you haven‚Äôt gotten so far, and then don‚Äôt ask, demand. Do you want a referral to an OBGYN?  Your exact words should be ‚ÄúI want a referral to an OBGYN.‚Äù  No ‚ÄúI was hoping for...‚Äù or ‚ÄúCould I get...?‚Äù  Do you want to try medication?  Have you had a pelvic exam yet?  Tell them exactly what you want and without being nasty make it clear you expect to get it or there had better be a good reason.']
['Yeah, I‚Äôve been a couple of times but have had no luck with the ED doctors. I might ask about the letter next time and see if that helps. Thank you!']
['Even worse, I think. Call and clarify. Maybe you could do it for a while and then stop some number of weeks beforehand? It is nice that she is concerned about your pain.']




Topic 21 sharing symptoms
feel period day days bad time every worse back last feeling even cramps week night much flare felt going sometimes month right started still getting

['I‚Äôm currently PMS‚Äôing and I‚Äôve been constantly dizzy for hours now. I was tossing and turning all night, and each time I‚Äôd move around I got super dizzy. Now I‚Äôm awake and even while I‚Äôm just laying in bed, I keep getting lightheaded and feel like I‚Äôm falling. Does anyone else get really dizzy like this during their cycles? \nI used to get dizzy on my period when I was younger but it‚Äôs never been this bad or sudden before.']
["Heaving bleeding, huge clots, insane cramps that oscillate between feeling like I have a bowling ball in my stomach and feeling like I'm being stabbed with knives over and over. Shitting my brains out and going into cold sweats on the toilet. Extreme fatigue, dizziness, migraines... the usual stuff with endo. The first 4 days make me feel like my pelvis is getting electrocuted in a toaster bath. "]
["Fast forward to now, woke up in the middle of the night last night with a terrible fever. Had a migraine that effected my vision so badly I couldn't drive. Started my period this morning. Fever has continued. Cramps have been completely debilitating today, and I feel intense pressure and pain in my lower back. I'm constipated, and feel pressure/cramping near my anus."]
["Anyone else get random sharp pains? Like you're being stabbed, you gotta stop what you're doing lay in a ball crying ready to vomit, but lasts just a minute or two then its gone? I get them a lot during my period but sometimes like just a bit ago not on my period. I assume its an endo thing since it's near my uterus and goes to my rectum but just wondering if anyone else has this?"]
["But here's the thing:\nBetween Thanksgiving 2020 and today, it's like my symptoms are multiplying like rabbits.\nFirst it was just the super painful and long periods came back. Then it was the constant pelvic pain came back. Then I felt it between my vagina and rectum (I call this Vlad the Impaler or just Vlad lol). Then I swear I feel it on the other? side of my rectum. Also intense ovary pain that fluctuates in constancy throughout my cycle. Then any kind of gas, bowel movement, or urination became consistently painful. Then I started getting the lightning again. Now the constant pain has pushed up a notch or two so it's constantly distracting. (All this to say nothing of the brain fog and fatigue.)"]
["Pain feels like someone stabbing me down there, with a knife. Cramps in my lower abdominal area.  Back pain, nausea and vomiting. The pain was horrible, I fainted several times. Also the feeling like you have to go to the toilet during those flare ups, vomit but once you are there it's the stabbing pain that makes you faint. Not being able to walk properly, sitting on the bathroom floor sobbing kind of pain."]
["I finally got my period. Yesterday I was nauseous all day and no appetite. Today my period started and I felt slightly better (was able to move about, not hating my life), I noticed I've been having pressure in my head off and on. Tonight it felt like horrible pressure rising all the way to the top/dizzy as well. My ears even feel weird. "]
['Do you have it the week before your period? Day before or week of? I‚Äôm on day two of the symptoms and feel worse today. So achy and my ears and throat hurt in addition to a low grade fever. I‚Äôm supposed to start tomorrow. I‚Äôm miserable and want to move and exercise but I can‚Äôt get off the couch lol']
['To top everything off, for the past month, I‚Äôve had constant breast tenderness and bloating. I can‚Äôt lie on my stomach to sleep anymore because of the breast pain. I‚Äôve been incredibly bloated almost every day and although it is aggravated by eating during the day, I wake up already extremely puffed up.']
["During ovulation, and 2/3 weeks after I randomly get a pain SO FREAKIN BAD on my left ovary, it feels like someone is stabbing me almost. The pain comes in waves the only way I can describe it is like a bloody contraction, it's that pain that builds and builds then stops till it comes back in a minute."]


['Does anyone else suffer from extreme fatigue? Most mornings I wake up feeling somewhat rested, but within a couple hours of being awake I‚Äôm already ready to crash. My body feels weak too.']
['How long did you guys experience cramps for? I had my period a couple days after surgery (was hella crampy). Then cramps stopped for a few days but I can feel then coming back again. Lower abdomen also just feels achy and sore']
['I barely eat anything when I get my period, because 20-30 minutes later I‚Äôm straight to the bathroom, sweating, moaning and crying  in pain, and have actually lost consciousness and blacked out a few times from my body not being able to handle the extreme pain. ']
['I immediately got a heavy feeling in my abdomen, huge abdominal swelling (bad in morning but awful by night), an almost completely inability to pass gas. &amp; and more worse constipation. When I bear down to poop or fart it just makes my whole lower abdomen hurt and feel tender. My stomach also feels a bit tender when I push on it. ']
["My pain comes and goes, but sometimes persists for a longer period of time. Like sometimes I'll have random pains that hurt for a few seconds and sometimes I'll feel like crap for 2 weeks at a time. I also randomly throw up even when I'm not in pain, just get super nauseas sometimes but it doesn't happen very often. Also I throw up every time I get my period, as that's the time when my pain is most intense. But I know for some people ovulation can be very painful too. "]
['The cold weather has been fuuuucking me up. I work mostly outside and this past week has been the absolute worst because it‚Äôs been so cold. I was bed ridden for four days and had to miss work. Does anyone else have cramps that are triggered by cold feet?? I feel like the second my feet touch the cold floor or cold shower floor it‚Äôs just instant debilitating cramps!']
["Some days I wake up in pain and it slowly subsides through out the morning then it'll come back mid to late afternoon and stay all evening/night, on bad days I wake up in the morning in agony and can't drag myself out of bed."]
["I've been suffering for 16 years myself and the last 3 years have been miserable. Unmedicated I get the sharp stabbing/tugging pain almost every breath! Also if I go without eating too long and my stomach starts growling, my pain flares SO bad. It's so annoying."]
['Yup. Horrible nausea and vomiting during ovulation, then usually again during my period but not as bad. Lately I‚Äôve been getting a break between the two, but in recent months I only had the one week after my period before ovulation that I felt ‚Äúok‚Äù.']
['Same here. The first two days of my period are totally debilitating, the next 3-5 are all right (I feel shitty but, ya know, I have my period), and then I get random pains until the week before my period, where I have a steady headache and constant nausea. ']


['Woke up, rolled over. Felt my temperature rising (normal when waking up). Then I suddenly felt everything melt into panic of ‚Äúwhat if this is a hot flash and I am going to have an episode?‚Äù ']
['The pain comes on randomly, it‚Äôs a can be either a dull ache or an intense cramp that wakes me out of my sleep - occasionally it‚Äôs triggered by movement like walking up stairs but I rarely get it when I exercise. ']
['Could be. My rectal pain is more of a stabbing sharp pain right up the bum when I‚Äôm about to have a bowel movement and sometimes randomly occurs throughout the day - keeps me awake at work!']
['It usually came accompanied with severe bloating and intestinal cramping, and it would feel like I had diarrhea, but would usually be mostly gas and clots when I tried to go to the toilet. It really terrified me.']
["I'm doing sooo much better. The constant crotch lightning and daily pain in my uterus are gone. No more pain shooting down mylegs or back. I'm not worried about bleeding everywhere. I'm not kept up all night from pain. "]
['- Severe lower abdominal cramping causing explosive diarrhea (sorry) and sometimes vomiting too, usually after this happens I pass out on the toilet and wake up on the floor.']
['I hate it, it can really happen within an hour! I woke up fine that day, had breakfast and felt a little funny, then boom, when I was getting changed it swelled up like crazy']
['This was me last night during ovulation. üò≠ I laid in bed with severe bloat, pain and my back felt like it got tweaked. Couldn‚Äôt stand up straight the rest of the night.']
['it‚Äôs gone in waves for me but yes. first day of my period I always gag or throw up .but before my period I had a span of 2 years where I was throwing up a lot from nausea and I don‚Äôt know what else']
['I would take it at bedtime and if I woke up to pee around 2 or 3 am I‚Äôd feel kind of sick and nauseous, and I‚Äôd stumble to the washroom but by the time I got up for the day there was zero nausea.']




Topic 22 clothing/comfort items
wear pants belly look weight one size wearing super cup much even feel underwear loose clothes use high jeans hair big lol bloated work fit

['I have jeans spanning sizes 8-12 so I can grab a looser pair if I need to. I have a super short torso, so high waisted jeans sit high on my mid section and don‚Äôt bother my bloat (as long as I didn‚Äôt grab the smaller size or they‚Äôre freshly washed). I know high waisted doesn‚Äôt work for everyone, but I will swear by them. American eagle has always been my fav brand of jeans. They have a wide range of sizes, lengths, cuts and fits. The super stretch jeggings and mom jeans are the best fits for me.']
['As for practical advice, stock up on cozy and/or necessity items. I bought myself fluffy socks for comfort. Make sure you have stretchy pants, like loose-fitting yoga pants or sweatpants. Now is a good time to wear dresses, if that is something you feel comfortable doing. You will not be able to tolerate a waistband for at least a month. Also, bring a pillow with you to keep between your torso and your seat belt or else car rides will be intolerable']
['I live in high waisted (above the belly!) mom/dad jeans (gotta love that roomy hip and butt area), but I have a few pairs of joggers like that and they are clutch! Bloat day? Don‚Äôt tie them and let them rest on my hips. They look adorable high waisted or low slung! And they‚Äôre super popular, you can get them pretty much anywhere. I‚Äôm currently wearing a new linen pair from Old Navy and they were 18 bucks. ']
['If you are a size 10+, I recommend Torrid‚Äôs dress pants made from ‚ÄúPonte‚Äù fabric. They look nice but feel like a heavy yoga pant, and there are coordinating blazers. I bought 2 black pairs each in the two sizes I fluctuate between, and those were my work staples for days I didn‚Äôt want to wear a dress. Bonus: they come in short-short to extra tall. They also have fairly inexpensive wide-waistband leggings']
['I pretty much only wear high waisted legging/stretch pants or sweat pants unless at work. I buy the beta brand work pants because they‚Äôre stretchier than regular dress pants. If I‚Äôm wearing something that one would normally wear tights with, I wear leggings and knee high socks to look like tights because the waist band on tights always causes pain. I‚Äôve entirely stopped buying cute lingerie type undergarments because I just never wear them, I only buy cotton bikini cut or granny panties because they‚Äôre just so much more comfortable.']
['Coucou, non j\'ai eu de tr√®s mauvaises exp√©riences dans les h√¥pitaux et avec une sp√©cialiste, je suis devenue vraiment phobique. Je voies un sp√©cialiste vraiment tr√®s tr√®s bien, qui m\'a m√™me redonn√© un RDV apr√®s avoir annul√© la celioscopie au tout mais tout dernier moment parce que j\'avais tr√®s peur, il m\'a dit "d√©sol√© j\'aurais du mieux vous rassurer" il m\'a dit qu\'√©norm√©ment de femmes √©taient traumatis√©s par leur exp√©riences et les violences gyn√©cologiques.']
["In the winter I wear dresses with over-the-knee socks and boots. I also can sometimes wear really high-waist jeans if they aren't super stiff, because if they go high enough it doesn't hurt my bloated belly. I like the loose, wide floral pants, I have a pair from Loft that are really comfortable with a wide, non-tight waistband. "]
['Stock up on cozy and/or necessity items. I bought myself fluffy socks for comfort. Make sure you have stretchy pants, like loose-fitting yoga pants pr sweatpants. Now is a good time to wear dresses, if that is something you feel comfortable doing. You will not be able to tolerate a waistband for at least a month. ']
['bambody\'s super absorbent underwear (for heavy flow/post-partum) and/or an Aisle reusable pad in the "super pad" 10 inch length. game-changing for me. i went from buying the always maxi overnight size 5 or whatever was longest to these + cup. (i don\'t need the cup with the aisle pad but when I can combine I do)']
['Edit: and this style definitely works in the winter. I put on big long boot socks and rock them with riding boots in the winters and in the warmer months I do flats and a lighter fabric top. Dresses for the warmer months are awesome. And you can do dresses in the winter with fleece tights and boots too!!']


["Lululemon align. 1000% the best leggings for endo I've ever worn. Super soft, stretchy, high waisted but without a waistline and without being too tight, not see-through, and they come in a few different styles."]
['Old navy swing dresses! Come in a variety of colors, patterns, and sleeve lengths. All seasons. Flowy and not restrictive. Pair the solids with a pretty patterned scarf. Love them.']
['I had one tiny inside the bellybutton incision and 3 tiny incisions just below the top of my public hair line. None of the scars are even visible anymore but you wouldn‚Äôt see them in a bikini.']
['I really like my Lucy and Yak dungarees when I‚Äôm feeling at my worst. They have a little stretch in them you can adjust the straps for a little more room around your middle and they look stylish. My ultimate wardrobe comfort item x']

['Same! I never realized pants were uncomfortable because I was bloated. My first pair of low rise jeans was like walking on clouds! To not have that pressure -- even the lightest amount -- on my stomach was amazing!']
['There‚Äôs a really great black skirt I got off Amazon for like 30 bucks and it‚Äôs amazing. It‚Äôs comfortable and it has enormous pockets. It‚Äôs also high waisted enough to sit above your tummy if you swell real bad.']
["I get No Boundaries, super soft, high-waisted leggings at Walmart in a size bigger than I usually wear. The waistband is high enough that it doesn't feel like it's digging into my bloated tummy."]
["When I had to wear business casual at work, I loved Ponte knit pants. They're structured like dress pants, so they look professional, but the fabric is stretchy like a thicker yoga pant."]


['I totally tried high waisted thick leggings the other day and it was surprisingly fine. Way better than the waistband cutting into me in any pants that aren‚Äôt too big.']
['This is actually a great idea. I can\'t stand jeans or waistbands that cut into my belly, but equal compression like this actually helps with the pain a bit. And I won\'t look as "pregnant" üôÑ']
['Clothes suck big time. I used to be able to wear pencil skirts and bodycon dresses and feel confident. I had to put them all away in the "one day I\'ll wear it again" drawer. Anyway, I often wear layered dresses that have "free" Hips, are enormously long and overly modest. I like dresses that have a cute neckline and sleeves (e.g Puffy sleeves and a sweet heart neckline or a lace mock neck) but loose fitting body. Maternity clothes is a good choice lol. With pants I only wear high waisted with a loose top that covers my stomach. If I\'m home then I\'m wearing granny gowns idc']
["The most comfortable i have been was with a high-waisted bikini bottom from Target and whatever top I wanted. Might be able to size up in something to make it less tight, too. I think the reason I like them so much is because the fabric over my tummy isn't tight and the waist band is higher than where I tend to have pain. The super high waisted ones could be nice to feel more like a one peice, but with the conceivence of sizing differently than your top."]
["Most of my wardrobe is empire-waisted dresses because of the comfort factor. I always feel pretty bangin' in ones with a v-neck or a faux wrap neckline, since they emphasize my bust. For more intimate wear, I love flitting around the house in a black lace robe and comfortable panties in a cute color, but I'm big enough that hiding my belly just isn't happening no matter what I wear so I don't tend to try."]
["I wound up buying lots of warm tights that were very loose on top to fit around my new stomach, and wore a-line dresses from my spring and summer wardrobe with a cardigan on top and on cold days, a uniqlo heatteach tshirt underneath the dress. It gave me the illusion of a figure. I was cold as hell, but nothing else fit me and I couldn't go to work in sweatpants. Also!! Uniqlo ultra stretch jeans work really well when your waist size fluctuates daily! Now that my incisions are healed, these are my main pants."]
['I mainly wear dresses and skirts. I have 2 pairs of the same American Eagle super stretch high waisted jeggings. One pair is in a bigger size for more bloated days. I also really love Old Navy yoga leggings. They are really soft and have a really wide comfy waistband.']
["Ye Im very bloated these days and I barely wear clothes. At home it's huge baggy night dresses outside its dresses that make me look like I'm pregnant. I usually have a nice hourglass shape and I love to wear cute dresses, these days dressing up gives me no joy at all"]
['Also, due to this, I wear pads. I‚Äôm pretty small framed and I can‚Äôt find a pad that isn‚Äôt either super long or super wide, unless it‚Äôs just like a panty liner or something. That‚Äôs obviously not going to work. Can anyone suggest a brand that has a smaller, petite size?']
['Sometimes I wear night gowns made with soft fabrics, their cute and appropriate to wear around family and you don‚Äôt have to worry about tight waistbands. Don‚Äôt laugh, but I also bought a pair of maternity leggings for when my endo belly bloat is bad. It hides it well and super comfy/not too constricting.']




Topic 23 medication
take side taking effects weight months pill medication dose NUMmg help ibuprofen meds day doctor mood depression orilissa lupron bad time tried prescribed pills one

["I don't think NSAIDs are the issue. There are prescription ones like Mefenamic acid or Naproxen (my preferred choice) which are strong. You should also be prescribed something to protect the stomach lining as well. Then these painkillers can be more effective in combination with a paracetamol and if needed with codeine type pain relief. In the UK the max you can get OTC in one dose of pain relief is 2x 342mg ibuprofen, 2x co-codamol (paracetamol and codeine combined)."]
["I did not personally experience this side effect during my time Orilissa, but I did experience a number of others. I was losing a lot of hair, nauseous, and very depressed. Sadly the side effects outweighed any improvement. It is a very strong drug, so while although you couldn't find anything then I would not be surprised. I also experienced very dry skin while taking Orilissa, so perhaps it's the dryness making her nose bleed?"]
["Every doctor I've talked to has tried to put me on another birth control, but I don't want to take BC because of the side effects. I've tried \\~7 different BC meds, (including nuvaring, the mini-pill, yaz) all at least for 6 months each and the side effects (depression, mood swings, acne, daily headaches) are not worth it. "]
["I've tried bc at  20mcg of estrogen and the lowest dose possible at 10mcg and the littlest amount reduced the overall pain a little but my aendo pain worse and put me in a 2 week long period. I was then put on orilissa and was throwing up off it and was just told to take anti nausea meds before I take it and to continue to take it. "]
["I don't have any suggestions for prescription medication, but in the meantime you can try acetaminophen (like what's in Tylenol). It doesn't have some of the side affects that ibuprofen (Advil) do. Also you can alternate taking both of those, so that you can take a smaller dose of each. (I take them each every four hours, and stagger by two hours - so advil at 1 pm, tylenol at 3 pm, advil at 5, tylenol at 7, etc) when in pain."]
['Aleve has worked a lot better for me than Advil or Tylenol. My gyno was concerned with the amount of Advil I was taking for pain management (like 6-7 pills at a time), and she said to take two Aleve for the first dose, then one pill every 12 hours as needed.']
['I found despgestrel here. But it should be taken with a doctor, i think. I am afraid to mess up my hormones. I took Qlaira for 5 months, now i take Yasmin only for one week. But i have always wanted to try something like Visanne or mini pill. It is called Laccinette here(the mini pill you said).']
["It's an older antidepressant, but it's used for so much more than that! At low doses like 10mg it's used for nerve pain, 30mg it's used for migraines and it works for depression around 100mg+. So when you take it at a low dose for pain you don't really get many side effects and it doesn't do anything for depression."]
['Codeine always does this to me I refuse to take it! It‚Äôs miserable. Hydrocodone isn‚Äôt much better, but it‚Äôs manageable with an anti-nausea med. Maybe you can talk to your doctor about prescribing a nausea med or changing pain meds? I hope it gets better!']
['\nWhen I started these medications I started to have extremely bad cystic acne. I also gained weight over time with these treatments. Just curious if anyone has experienced weight gain? I just stopped taking it and noticed my acne is starting to get a lot better.']


['I‚Äôve only used gabapentin for sleep/anxiety at a super low dose. Around the time I took it I remember having pretty high amounts of pain but again that‚Äôs not why I took it and I was on a low dose to get me to sleep again then weaned off of it']
['Hi! Orlissa (150)took all my pain away within 3 days. My doc also told me to take continue to take visanne along with calcium &amp; D3 daily with the pills as a precaution. ']
['I took an anti inflammatory called ponstan every day and at first it was my miracle drug. Then it slowly stopped working and I gave myself a stomach ulcer from it. Just be careful!!']
["She prescribed me cyclobenzaprine, the pills are 5 mg each and I can take up to two (10 mg). It's the only muscle relaxant I've ever tried but at least for me it seems to help a lot! Might be worth mentioning to your doctor?"]
['I‚Äôm in Orilissa and it started giving me terrible hot flashes. I talked to my doctor and he put me on some progestin and that has helped immensely. My hot flashes are pretty much gone.']
['Yep. Experienced weight gain on it as well. What eventually worked for me was to quit taking it. Weight gain was just one of the many unbearable side effects unfortunately.']
["I don't take birth control (was offered it, but personally was hesitant about the side effects), and only take Aleve when I'm having a lot of pain; even then, I try to only take it at night, as needed. It's very rare that I take Aleve for more than a few days at a time, and I'll have a lot of pain every few months (most days, even if I have some pain here and there, it's manageable without meds)."]
["I personally really liked it. I only took it for 1 year, but while I was on it my pain was SIGNIFICANTLY lessened, and my only side effect was hot flashes. Birth control always gave me horrible side effects and never did anything for my pain, so it was a huge relief to find a medication that actually worked *and* didn't give me awful side effects."]
['I was given Vissane, progesterone only pill (my specialist told me it\'s typically the estrogen that gives the worst of the side effects). A side effect of Visanne is depression &amp; anxiety and I already have a Generalized Anxiety disorder so it was scary to start it. But I take it at night time now (the first week was in the morning and it caused my anxiety to spike to an all time high but switching to night time has eased it and it is back to my "normal"). ']
['My doctor has suggested a "cocktail" of 500 mg  acetaminophen plus 600 mg ibuprofen every 6 hours as needed for pain. My dentist suggested the same combo after dental surgery. The recommendation from them both came with the warning that it was not for long term and to not exceed the daily recommended doses of each medication. \nIt has worked for me when nothing else does, including percocet. ']


["&gt; It's transemic acid to prevent excessive bleeding and mefanamic acid (a NSAID), they are prescribed in conjunction with one another and meant to be taken together."]
['I‚Äôve also tried this anti depressant thing that was supposed to help endo, it‚Äôs called Venlafaxine, but it did nothing besides giving me tons of side effects. ']
['Diane is an incredibly "strong" pill, with anti androgenic effects is that what you were on when the hair loss started, or is it to try and stop the hair loss.']
["I'm not sure why mine says that. I'll be taking 5mg three times a day (so 15mg a day in total) which seems to be about the highest dose."]
['I heat you about opioids and benzodiazepines. I used to take Ativan for anxiety but now I just take an SSRI (Lexapro). The Lexapro had worked wonders for my health/medical anxiety.']
["30. After the initial couple weeks of hot flashes and night sweats, it's evened out. A lot less pain. It's not like that for everyone, though. I had terrible pain before it, though."]
['Yea and the higher the dose it seems the worse brain fog you have.  I take 1200 mg three times a day at the most but I have tapered off twice a day.']
['I had a similar experience. Tried about half a dozen different kinds. They regulated my period and cleared my skin  so that was nice, but the trade off was weight gain, mood swings, depression and other side effects. With no reduction in pain, I decided it was not worth it any more. Skin is clear and cycle is regular a decade later, but pain is still significant. I am not willing to put myself through trying BC of any kind again.']
["It's an older antidepressant, but it's used for so much more than that! At low doses like 10mg it's used for nerve pain, 30mg it's used for migraines and it works for depression around 100mg+. So when you take it at a low dose for pain you don't really get many side effects and it doesn't do anything for depression"]
['Side note, huge doses of NSAIDs prescribed by doctors were what cause my GI issues. To the point where they put me on some med that cost $1600 a month that was basically an NSAID mixed with an antacid. I was on 12 medications, half were for pain and the other half to deal with the side effects.']

['3) GnRH modulators. These drugs drastically lower your estrogen (putting you in a menopause-like state). Lupron is the older version, which works by agonizing GnRH receptors, leading initially to a large increase in estrogen. Your body responds by then drastically lower estrogen release. The newer drug is Orlissa, which is a GnRH antagonist, so it lowers estrogen directly without relying on the same feedback mechanism as Lupron. Both can have considerable side effects and are not approved for long term use. However, some people get symptom relief and really like these drugs. As with birth control, there is not really any evidence that these get rid of the underlying disease. ']
['\nEndometriosis is an estrogen dependent disease. Taking drugs that stabilize estrogen (birth control) or lower estrogen (Lupron and Orilissa) can help manage Endometriosis symptoms while the drug is being taken. The side effects of these drugs are mostly related to estrogen being lowered and the way they lower estrogen. There will likely be some side effects - the question is are the side effects tolerable to where the endo relief is worth it. Bone density loss and severe mood changes typically are NOT worth staying on drug. A drug that can get out of the system quickly is more desirable. ']
['&gt;It might help to understand in a bit more detail what Lupron actually is and what it does to your body. Lupron is an analogue (a manufactured form) of GnRH which is a hormone that occurs naturally in your body. This means it acts as an agonist at the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland, which means it binds to the receptors and causes them to respond in the same way as natural GnRH does. The result of this is that initially the agonism of the GnRH receptors stimulates the production of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). This is part of a normal process in your body called the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, that ultimately controls things like when you ovulate or menstruate. (Essentially the normal menstrual and ovulating cycle is a process involving the cyclic secretion and then inhibition of various hormones, which control the thickening of the uterine lining, release of eggs, etc,). This means that initially after you first take Lupron this action as analogue GnRH makes the HPG axis increase the levels of estradiol and testosterone (as though you suddenly had lots of GnRH) and this is actually the opposite of what you want and causes a flare in your condition (which may be what you are currently experiencing). Then, after a while, because there is so much stuff binding to the GnRH receptors the feedback mechanism makes the receptors become desensitised. Which means they are also desensitised to your bodies natural GnRH. This is the ultimate objective of taking the Lupron as at that point everything becomes downregulated and LH and FSH are suppressed, which leads to a significant reduction in estradiol and testosterone. This suppression hopefully suppresses the endo and your menstrual cycle, however unfortunately because it is essentially causing temporary menopause it also produces the side effects associated with menopause']
["Progesterone is absorbed very poorly via the oral route, for my IVF rounds they had me use progesterone vaginally where it was absorbed much more readily. You might talk to your doctor about using progesterone vaginally. If you suspect you may have PCOS it's important to tackle that as well as the endo, both conditions complicate each other. I've had an endo specialist recommend vaginal danazol to me, might be another option to research. Danazol has known masculinizing side effects, but taking it vaginally seems to reduce them significantly."]
['As you probably already know, Lupron is a GnRH agonist (an artificial analogue of a hormone found naturally in both men and women). Lupron acts by increasing the apparent amount of GnRH which desensitises the receptors for this in the pituitary gland, and this reduces/stops the gland from excreting certain hormones. These hormones would normally trigger the ovaries or testes to produce estrogen and testosterone. So Lupron ultimately acts to reduce testosterone production from testes and reduce estrogen production from ovaries.']
["I mean, not really. It's a progestin, a synthetic progesterone. There are many progesterone-only birth control pills, typically called minipills, and there are some traditional birth control pills that contain dienogest/Visanne. If you don't do well on minipills, Visanne may not be for you. It likely will negatively impact your ability to get pregnant while on it and therefore is not ideal for people who are trying to conceive, but it isn't really intended to be used as a contraceptive and I was told to use backup methods if trying to avoid a pregnancy."]
["Generally high progestins such as Aygestin are given to suppress people's periods and lower estrogen which is by far safer than Lupron and can be used for longer. Both lower your estrogen but you can at least quit with the pill if it makes your pain worse and with Lupron you just can't. But some people do great with low estrogen so for that reason I'd strongly suggest trying that first over Lupron. Especially if fertility is a concern ovarian function may not fully restore afterwards on Lupron."]
["There are many different varieties of BC pill with varying levels of different kinds of hormones. If you find the one you're currently on isn't a good fit I'd suggest looking up what hormones (ex progesterone, estrogen or androgens) are dominant in it and asking your Dr to try a pill that has a different composition. It's generally accepted that progesterone only or progesterone dominant pills are better for endometriosis, but that's not always the case. Everyone is different and that's why there's so many kinds to choose from!"]
['The level of suppression depends on the dose. At lower doses it won‚Äôt stop your cycle, but will reduce the amount of estrogens released by your ovaries. Unfortunately as u/Comorbid_Joke has  said,  endo  lesions  may  be  able  to  produce  their  own  hormones,  so  this  treatment  might  not  work  for  everyone.  It  is  also  possible that  you  arent  on  a  high  enough dose  for  suppression  for  you  personally,  but  higher  doses  with  more  suppression  also  means  potentially  more  side  effects.']
['Hormone treatment works to block or reduce the estrogens production of body and put woman into an artificial pregnancy state or menopausal state, making endometriosis unable to continue growing and helping to relieve symptoms. Oral contraceptives and vaginal rings are usually used to control hormone. Please note that this therapy has no effect on adhesions and the endometriosis may return if you stop the treatment.']


["The hormonal effect of the Mirena is localised, which is actually one of its advantages over the pill for a lot of people as many people who can't take the pill because of its side effects of the hormones can have a Mirena. But I suspect this also means that it won't help control your hormone related problems in other parts of the body."]
['A hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries) can treat endometriosis in some cases by causing surgical menopause, but it is important to remember that this is a sudden irreversible menopause state that has significant associated risks and usually necessitates hormone replacement therapy afterwards to mitigate these.']
['If the goal is to reduce your pain levels and stop the disease from progressing, then there are other options other than the Depo shots. I for one, take a drug called Danazol, which does the same thing, but tends to have less side effects than Depo or Lupron, plus I can use it long term to control my disease.']
['Most of the research also seems to indicate that removing the ovaries makes it take longer for the endo to come back, but if you are only 30 you will risk getting other diseases, since the ovaries have a very important function in your body. To avoid bone loss you would have to take hormone replacements and then you risk the endo getting worse. ']
["And you are very misinformed on the use of birth control and hysterectomies as treatments.\nEndo operates on estradiol - or estrogen produced by the ovaries. It's the trigger for our disease, and in terms of suppressing the disease, it's the hormone we can control in order to suppress the endo from returning, or to help control symptoms of disease already present."]
["And for what it's worth, I wouldn't do more surgeries. They should be looking at a long term drug therapy that suppress the disease. You can't do Lupron and surgery forever. I would ask about drugs like Danazol. That will keep her pain at bay, and work towards keeping the disease from coming back and making more adhesions and lesions."]
["Have you tried switching to a different pill? I've tried multiple brands before and some brands work for the pain, some not so much. Try a few different brands before resorting to extreme measures like hysterectomy or stronger hormone treatments because those could come with even worse side effects."]
['"But we have provided evidence that progestin treatment may be of limited efficacy in endometriosis due to a state of progesterone resistance. Indeed, although progestins have been utilized for therapy with some efficacy, pain-relief can be short-term and a subset of patients fails to respond entirely"']
["It sounds like you were on something like Lupron, which induces artificial menopause. The general consensus is that it can shrink endometriosis lesions, but not irradicate the disease nor prevent it. However, some people find it helps their symptoms. Contraceptive in general is used to manage symptoms of endometriosis, but it doesn't prevent regrowth."]
["If you're looking for something to suppress periods without feeding endo, you should consider the Depo Provera shot or an implant or hormonal IUD, as these do not contain estrogens. Make sure your prescribing doctor is aware that limiting estrogen exposure is key to slowing the growth of endo."]


['I read online that the recurrence rate for endometriomas after excision is relatively high (24% and I have all of the risk factors).  Has anyone had any success with anything such as the endo diet, IUD, continuous birth control, etc to keep them from coming back?']
["I'm definitely not an expert, but having an IUD works differently to keep your uterine lining thin. Meaning less bleeding.  The same way that hormonal stops bleeding, by tricking your body to keep the uterine lining thin. "]
['Lupron has lasting effects on your body because It‚Äôs essentially a chemotherapy drug. However I  know some women have been fine on it because everyone is different. But personally i would stay clear of Lupron and first try a less invasive drug if at all possible.']
['Both of them can only be taken for finite lengths of time and may require adback hormones to prevent side effects. This is because they are essentially inducing a menopause like state and early menopause isn‚Äôt good for many other aspects of the body. ']
['Many people (myself included) find the Mirena coil helps as this has localised hormones at a much lower dose than oral contraceptives and so some people find they can have this without side effects, unlike the pill for example.']
["Excision of the endometriosis and hysterectomy are surgical options, but no treatment is a guarantee of symptom relief. Your doctor should work with you to find the most effective and appropriate treatment for you. If hormone birth control is more trouble than it's worth, it's ok to decline that option."]
["Have you tried any pill version of hormonal birth control? Whilst women all react differently to various pills and therefore success isn't guaranteed, at least they are much less permanent than IUDs or Nexplanon."]
['There is no medication that exists that treats or cures endo.  What your doctor has given you is a temporary band-aid that may or may not treat your symptoms, but not the disease.  Menopause in any form is no joke and medication (Lupron, Orlissa, etc.) are only to be taken short term and carry a host of side effects, some irreversible.  For example, Lupron is given to men for prostrate cancer but they have discovered that it will also cause dementia. ']
['Lupron is an artificial analogue for the GnRH hormone that acts as an agonist at the GnRH receptors, the result being that the GnRH receptors are desensitised and downregulated, ultimately leading to an alteration in the production of other hormones. Essentially Lupron is temporarily suppressing certain aspects of ovarian function, which people often refer to as ‚Äúartificial menopause‚Äù. When you stop taking Lupron this process reverses.']
['For most people this means hormonal birth control. IUDs and progestin only pills are popular but many have success with COCs. The other alternative is Lupron or Orlissa, which can help but can also have nasty side effects so approach with caution. ']
