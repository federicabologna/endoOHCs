# Why is there no dataset in this folder?

Though data from r/Endo and r/endometriosis is public, members of online communities do not necessarily anticipate that their posts and comments could be used by academic researchers. By collecting, analyzing, and publishing research about this data, we extract the data from its intended audience, bringing it to a new, unanticipated audience. Following prior examples of handling sensitive, health-related data, we decide not to public release the source data to protect members from being identified in relation to their posts or comments.

However, in order to further research on this much stigmatized and neglected condition, we will make the data available to researchers upon reasonable request. Please email Federica Bologna at fb265@cornell.edu.
