I am a 29 year old female and a Registered Nurse, suffering with stage 3 to 4 endometriosis and within the last year, developed major pelvic sepsis and 2 x cystic like pelvic collections. The cause of my sepsis is still unknown, but could be due to microperforations from my rectum or higher up in my descending colon, or perforation of my uterus from the mirena I had in at the time.\nI have had countless surgeries to ablate and dissect endo and scar tissue from many many areas in my pelvis and. I have also undergone many exploratory surgeries and procedures including surgery on my left lung last May (symptoms of catamenial pneumothorax including chest pain and haemoptysis), sigmoidoscopies for rectal bleeding during menstruation and most recently a cystoscopy for painful urination. I am currently on zoladex (3 monthly injection), of which I have been in for approximately 9 months. I have unfortunately developed neuropathic pain which started approximately there months after my first surgery in 2006. Currently I am struggling with mood swings and crippling anxiety and am very reluctant to give myself my next zoladex injection :( this year I am going to do IVF as a single woman and am very excited about it!! I would love to hear from others who are sharing similar experiences. \n","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/1wevtx/severe_endometriosis_sufferer_looking_for_support/","_input_hash":2124010300,"_task_hash":-90415624,"spans":[{"text":"love","start":1318,"end":1322,"pattern":369863969}],"label":"PARTNER","meta":{"pattern":"30"},"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject"}

Eventually I convinced my mom with the help of a doctor to put me on depo, which helped a LOT. About 4 months ago I started having cramps that were just horrible even though I no longer get periods. They could happen at any time. Then I started spotting, saw an OBGYN and was put on the pill in addition to my depo. Didn't help. Then they tried just estrogen (thinking progesterin + progesterin/estrogen put my progesterin out of whack). Still didn't work. Normal ultrasound as well. My OBGYN poked around in my medical history. Painful periods, painful sex (my first bf was upset that I was always saying \"ow!\"). Then she did a pelvic exam earlier this week and when she hit the \" cul-de-sac\" I practically screamed! She highly suggested laparoscopy. She told me she was almost positive it was my ailment and the whole \"only way to get a positive diagnosis\" thing. And it's resistant to hormones, though she thinks the depo helped but stopped being as effective at blocking the pain/keeping the \"spots\" small as my body got used to it.","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/3h2717/20_yo_and_getting_lap_on_the_27th_am_nervous_and/","_input_hash":1281010758,"_task_hash":1556335500,"spans":[{"text":"bf","start":852,"end":854,"pattern":-761108159}],"label":"PARTNER","meta":{"pattern":"26"},"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"classification","answer":"accept"}

{"id":"Endo_3sfw10_0","text":"So here I sit in my hospital bed, I've just drank my first sachet of Picolax and now I wait.....\nI've been told my surgery should be in the morning, I'm the only person my consultant will be operating on so hopefully there won't be any delays. Upon admission the nurse said all yesterday's surgeries had to be cancelled because there was no beds so I am eternally grateful to be laying here this evening.\nMy last excision surgery was performed less that a year ago on Dec 22nd. As I lay here this eve I can't help but think of how different I felt only 11 months ago. Before my surgery last year I was completely incapacitated: I couldn't walk or stand for any length of time, Chris often had to carry me to and from the bathroom, I ate a concoction of slow and fast release analgesics, I visited A&amp;E a couple of times a week. I remember looking forward to my surgery because I was going to be normal. I was going to be a new me. However I had the surgery and life was different, but I wasn't normal. I had pain again only a few weeks after my surgery; i wasn't pain free and normal. I remember the soul destroying and heart wrenching disappointment when the pain came back. I was devastated. I hadn't allowed pain to be a potential outcome, I had been completely over zealous and set my heart on an unrealistic outcome. \nI hurt both physically and mentally for a long time, I mourned a life unknown...not lost. You see the thing is I've had endometriosis since I've been 13, I've never known pain free, normal to me isn't pain free. I wasn't pain free from my surgery but I was much better. So I started to readjust my expectations. \nThe hard cold fact is my body has been attacked by endometriosis for 13 years, that's 13 years of mass internal bleeding, that's 13 years of scarring, that's 13 years of adhesions, that's 13 years of muscles distorted to protect themselves from the pain. Plus 4 surgeries, 4 times my abdomen has been sliced and torn open, 4 times I've been poked and proded, 4 times my body had to knit itself closed and heal...and I had the damn cheek to ask my body to be pain free?! I was surprised when it wasn't?! Hell I'm lucky this body of mine manages to get itself out of bed some days and stay vertical!\nSince my last surgery I have really learned the importance of expectations, aiming for what's achievable and celebrating the improvements - instead of wishing they'd be more significant. I have an incurable illness; sometimes it sucks, sometimes it's cruel but it is what it is and torturing myself over unachievable ambitions is a self punishment I could do without.\nThis evening I look back over the last few months with a smile, I had some lovely times. I've been on a few holidays that would have been impossible this time last year. I've had a job where I stood for 8 ,9, 10 hours (it may not be my dream job but I was able to do it). I have a car that I can actually drive regularly because I'm not on constant slow release mind muddling opioids (there have actually been days I haven't needed much pain relief). I have been able to get out to see my friends, I've drank wine with Chris, I've danced at weddings, I've had lots of laughs and made some beautiful memories. I have had a beautiful wonderful perfectly imperfect time.\nIt's important to reflect upon what you do have rather that what you don't. What you have gained rather than what you have lost. What opportunities lay ahead rather than what obstacles block your way.\nYes I am currently sweating from every orifice, yes I am currently pooping every other minute because of my wonderful bowel prep (this has taken much longer to write than it should have), yes tomorrow my body will undergo its 5th surgical assault but nevertheless I am smiling. I am excited to see what I gain because of tomorrow. I am excited for the opportunities my surgery will create. This time I have no doubt I will be in pain, I have no doubt that the aches will resurface, I have no doubt I'll have to work relentlessly until I'm exhausted rehabilitating my body; despite this I am happy, hopeful and excited - a new me will emerge tomorrow.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/3sfw10/expectations/","_input_hash":-1328931694,"_task_hash":1394545836,"label":"PARTNER","score":0.7777152061,"priority":0.7777152061,"spans":[],"meta":{"score":0.7777152061},"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject"}

He also said he couldn't remove everything from my bowels without perforating them, and I've had serious pain since (not worse than before, it just hasn't really gone away and he told me preop he'd be able to help the pain with surgery...). I've also had severe pain in my left ovary where he removed a lot of lesions and scar tissue, which again he said I shouldn't be feeling any pain...I've been instructed not to come in for an appointment to assess ongoing symptoms with him, but to take ibuprofen for the pain and wait until I need my depo shot again (I called his nurse who spoke with him).

When I was sixteen after months of agonising pain during, I was diagnosed with a 13cm ovarian cyst, which was surgically removed. I do however still suffer from terribly heavy periods.

I have been to the doctors at least 5 times where they have tested for STI's, thrush, BV, and cancer. The only test that came back positive was for thrush - which I have been treated for unsuccessfully five times with different drugs. My doctor told me that even though I test positively for thrush this is common for a lot of women to have and may not be the cause of the symptoms, yet she has done nothing to investigate otherwise! \nI also have had instances of excruciating pain in the top of my leg between my hips. \nIt is also worth mentioning I have the copper coil (IUD) which I had inserted a year ago, therefore I don't believe it has anything to do with that. \nAnother possible symptom is that I am very bloated and constipated a lot of the time. \nHas anyone who has been diagnosed suffered these symptoms (especially the discharge and pain)?

{"id":"Endo_46m6vp_0","text":"Hi ladies,\nSo I had laser surgery a year ago and got essentially no relief. Currently, I've been doing a lot of research into the immunological aspect of endo (super interesting new study here:http://endometriosisnews.com/2016/01/25/uterine-leukocyte-function-and-dysfunction-a-hypothesis-on-the-impact-of-endometriosis/)  and will be trying plaquenil per this study (http://endometriosisnews.com/2016/01/20/effect-of-hydroxychloroquine-and-characterization-of-autophagy-in-a-mouse-model-of-endometriosis/) which I linked to in a previous post. I was hoping to have surgery at the Center for Endo Care in Atlanta, but it's just too far and way, *way* too expensive. So I'm wondering what to do next...I'm thinking of just having another surgery at my local hospital to stop these ever-worsening cycles, and hoping that plaquenil will also do something. There is only one excision specialist in my state and she's almost 2 hours away. For those of you who have had excision surgery, does it really make a difference? I've read that it does, of course, but it seems like so many women still struggle after excision so I'm starting to wonder if it's worth all the trouble to try to track down a specialist right now. Particularly if the future of endo research is in immunology I wonder how much the type of surgery matters...? I keep going back and forth.

{"id":"Endo_6gobxc_0","text":"So. Long journey, please bear with me.        \nBack in November, i had ( what i now know was) an endometrial cyst rupture and put me in the hospital for 3 days. No surgeries were done, they just monitored me and drugged me the whole time. I followed up with that doctor, we'll call him Dr. Dick, and had to keep insisting that there was still something terribly wrong. (Nonstop pain) He kept me on various pain killers and birth controls and then finally in February, he agreed to do surgery. That's when he found that i had endo. One of my ovaries was shot, so he took that, along with my tubes (i don't want kids).  When I followed up with him and asked about the endo and what that means, and how it might effect my life, Dr. Dick said \"it won't\" and that was the end of it. So after I was all healed up, i started feeling similar pains on the side that I still has an ovary. I got a scan and Dr. Dick said basically \"Yeah there's another cyst but it's probably unrelated so you're fine.\" and then that was the end of it.        \nSo that's when I found this sub, and then Nancy's nook, and then a really awesome doctor, we'll call him Dr. O'Cool. So my husband and I go to my first appointment with Dr. O'Cool and he literally talks with us for an hour and a half! I don't think I'd talked to Dr. Dick for that much time in total over 6 months. Anyway, he talked to us about everything endo related and answered all of our questions. He took a look around and saw that my uterus was immoble which was causing my pain (which was nonstop). We assured him that we absolutely do not want kids and if we change our minds in the future, we'd actually prefer to adopt. So he said he'd do excision, a hysterectomy, appendectomy, and with my family history, the gallbladder might also need to go. I told him if the other ovary is screwed up, he can take that too.  Basically i said he could take anything I don't need to live, but definitely take anything that has been or will cause me pain. Like i said, the pain was nonstop basically from November.       \nSo my surgery was on the first and, man he cleaned up shop! Uterus, appendix, gallbladder, ovary, and while he was in there, he did a bladder suspension to prevent me from needing one later.  My mom was like \"He can do that?! Why couldn't they have done that with MY hyst?!\"          \nThe surgery went great, and he did an awesome job of getting the gas out before closing me up. I had almost NO gas pain so that was awesome. A couple of days after surgery i seemingly wet the bed... Twice!  I was awake for the second time and it was totally uncontrollable and seemed to be coming out of my vagina. So i texted Dr. O'Cool (yes he gave me his cell number) and even though it was a Sunday, he told me to go ahead and go to the ER and he'd see me there. They ran tests, did scans, and figured out that i had an abscess. And Dr. O'Cool said i was on the verge of getting really sick so it was a really good thing i came in. They got me on antibiotics, put a drain in me and kept me for a few days until my fever stayed down. They're gonna look at the drain tomorrow to see if it's time to come out. Even with all that, i feel 10x better than i did 10 days after the last surgery. My bruising is way less, I'm in less pain, and generally just feeling better. I feel super confident that this shit has finally been taken care of.        \nTldr; don't go to a doctor you don't feel confident with.

{"id":"Endo_5tae0o_5","text":"Alright moving onto the actual symptoms and knowledge after reading that possibly boring hospital story. I am turning 17 in just a month, so hearing all your painful experiences as a young adult and older, dealing with it makes me incredibly sad and sorry. No one should live through that pain and ignorance for years. Although my pain is manageable with medicine, I'm starting to suffer too quickly on my first days so I have to miss occasionally one day of school just to curl up and hope the painkillers work. Sometimes it does. Sometimes it doesn't.  THe pain kind of climbs from the right side to the left in slow gradual rises and less pain as if i can feel the contractions itself. Then it repeats. My period only lasts a mere 5 days but it only hits like a truck the very first day  and gone the rest, but sometimes i can feel it on the second or third too. Its not very clear nor can I predict it. I don't typically feel pain outside my designated time,  but a few times ( with my last one being the most severe) I could feel the ovulation that could only be compared to my actual period cramps. I normally never felt it before. IT goes on and off with a sharp occasional stab every day. Or every few days. But it doesn't end when ovulation should stop. It continues on until my period starts. It does feel like the pain is progressively getting worse each time. My lower dose of meds from elementary school no longer work. Now it has to be a higher dose or extra strength. Using the washroom during my pain usually results in tiny chunks of diarrhea. When I experienced the pain before I went to the hospital, trying to use the washroom as relief, my feces were a little strangely dark, or black, small, and strange.

Back when I was young I went to see a gyno as I would regularly faint at school, bleed through my clothes, be on my period for 2-3 weeks at a time no breaks and it exhausted me. As I was so young then the gyno just dismissed it as 'anaemia' which was probably a result of losing so much blood, but definitely not the root cause. Since then I have dabbled with BC, the pill has helped calm the pain and heavy bleeding but since being off the pill in a hope to conceive (last year) my periods have not regulated, the pain leaves me bed bound for 2-3 days and I have not conceived :(. I'm getting periods every 15 - 20 days and am suffering from chronic pain before, during and after so it basically feels like I'm constantly on my time of month, which also lasts for 7 - 9 days too of heavy bleeding, fatigue, sometimes fainting, lethargy and low energy.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/6r3d6c/if_its_not_endo_what_else_could_it_be/","_input_hash":1546314338,"_task_hash":-968582098,"label":"PARTNER","score":0.0003673167,"priority":0.0003673167,"spans":[],"meta":{"score":0.0003673167},"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject"}

I explained how bad my cramps can get, and how Advil and Midol don't help. The pain is sometimes debilitating, but I have just dealt with it. Once, a few years ago, I was experiencing such awful cramps that I broke out in a cold sweat and next thing I remembered was waking up on my bathroom floor covered in sweat. Then this last Fall of 2017, I woke up one night because I started having bad menstrual cramps. Went to the restroom, and then it hit me out of nowhere. Excruciating cramps, to the point I became disoriented and almost felt like I was going to pass out. I knew I needed to get back to my bed, and some how I managed to stumble back, but I just collapsed on to the bed. It woke up my partner who quickly realized something was very wrong. I remember her asking me what was wrong and not being able to really respond because of the pain. The only word I managed to get out was, \"cramps\". I laid there in the fetal position, covered in a cold sweat. She quickly grabbed the heating pad for my back, and a cold rag for my forehead. She made me take some Midol, but the cramps were not subsiding. 20 minutes into this excruciating pain, the possibility of calling 911 was suggested. Thankfully, my cramps began to slowly subside from excruciating pain to bearable pain.  I was able to talk again, and I just laid there in exhaustion from the pain I had just experienced.

I have had suspected endometriosis since I was 16, but other than birth control, I couldn't find a doctor that was willing to help treat me. After years of chronic pelvic pain, heavy periods, I started inquiring again about my condition. I was given different hormonal treatments but nothing seemed to work. Two years ago, I started having flank pain, blood in urine and kidney infection like symptoms that put me in the hospital which is when my suspicions of endo on my urinary tract started. This happened again around 3 months later. I was told by the emergency doctor that other than a \"benign\" cyst, I looked perfectly healthy and was sent on my way with a bottle of morphine pills. I was diagnosed with endometriosis by laparoscopy last year and had an 8 cm endometrial cyst removed as well as endo on my ovaries,  cul de sac, and bladder. I needed surgery because I was at risk for ovarian torsion. My symptoms, improved, but never went away. I still had deep pain that cycled with my periods and I started getting flank pain again 4 months after my surgery. I'm a scientist, so I did what I do best and researched as much as I could and asked my specialist about endometriosis on my urinary tract. She said likely it wasn't because its rare (OK sure) but that I could have endometriosis on my diaphragm (is that not more rare?) which is causing the flank pain. She admitted to not checking for urinary tract endo since it wasn't common procedure (even though she knew about the flank pain). Then I was sent on my merry way with no suggestions as what that means, another bottle of pain killers, and more hormones I have to take on top of having an IUD.

However upon my last period, (oct.9th) I never stopped bleeding and about 2 weeks into it I started getting worse and worse pain. The pain began to get so bad that prescription pain medication wouldn't even touch it. I had to start calling out of work, I haven't been eating so much because of the pain, etc. I made an appointment with the only gyno in town as that I have an ovarian cyst and wanted to know what was going on. I get in and get examined and finally he tells me this, \"yeah you still have a cyst there and you are bleeding but you dont have any free fluid and I cant do anything for you. Go to the ER and get a follow up with me.\" Naturally the no help made me feel dismissed and extremely angry. Nonetheless I went to the ER and they didnt prescribe me with anything nor give me a diagnosis. I am at my sanitys end with the healthcare system and make an appointment with a doctor over an hour away. He pulls up my records and I provided my own copies of my scans and records that I had looked over (my left ovary is sitting extremely high up and over double the size of my right arm the time of my er visit). Instead of taking me to an exam room I get pulled back into an office and he says he wants me to describe the pain and my health history. He is almost without a doubt before I even sit down that I have endometriosis and says based off of the pain and how my periods have always been bad that it's probably in the 90% range of likely. I do not have health insurance and currently we are exploring 2 options at the same time, orilissa (sp?) and doing a laparoscopic to see if it is and maybe give me some relief and if not, well what can we see while in there (I have tons of other health issues). Well my pain levels have not changed at all and we havent come to a decision on which route to explore because of the money issue.

None offer the same relief as hydrocodone in the first 2-3 days of my period. I\u2019ve also tried CBD and Kratom - kratom is the best of any of the above, but still not as helpful. My question is, are endo sufferers in other cities/towns finding this to be the situation for them as well? Has anyone experienced similar refusals from doctors and figured out a way to overcome it or convince doctors to treat them with small narcotic prescriptions? My last long term OBGYN literally said she couldn\u2019t see me anymore after prescribing 15-30 Norcos every few months. The one I most recently saw said he has committed to being a 100% narcotic free practice. I know all too well about the opioid crisis, but I feel like this is being taken to the extreme (and quite frankly, not helping... people wanting a fix are just going to turn to even more unsafe street drugs, but that\u2019s a whole other forum). Anyone who has successfully navigated this in the current state of medicine I would love to hear from.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/8w5awv/pain_relief_struggle/","_input_hash":-312586737,"_task_hash":-354513746,"label":"PARTNER","score":0.0139831714,"priority":0.0139831714,"spans":[],"meta":{"score":0.0139831714},"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject"}

Eventually I convinced my mom with the help of a doctor to put me on depo, which helped a LOT. About 4 months ago I started having cramps that were just horrible even though I no longer get periods. They could happen at any time. Then I started spotting, saw an OBGYN and was put on the pill in addition to my depo. Didn't help. Then they tried just estrogen (thinking progesterin + progesterin/estrogen put my progesterin out of whack). Still didn't work. Normal ultrasound as well. My OBGYN poked around in my medical history. Painful periods, painful sex (my first bf was upset that I was always saying \"ow!\"). Then she did a pelvic exam earlier this week and when she hit the \" cul-de-sac\" I practically screamed! She highly suggested laparoscopy. She told me she was almost positive it was my ailment and the whole \"only way to get a positive diagnosis\" thing.

Only to be in significant amount of pain from the ablation afterwards, have a tiny bit of relief and now feeling like I'm back to square one. Have been off work for months and now I've been suffering with bleeding again for well over a month. AGAIN. I've found relief in Tiger Balm (for those attached to a hot water bottle like I am most of the time this is an epic alternative!) and obviously the normal cocktail of drugs. The pain is still there.. and so is the bleeding. It's giving me headaches and stressing me out! Not to mention ruining countless pairs of knickers!!\nAbout to go and see my dr... I'm hoping there's a course of action I can take or he can offer some type of explanation. This can't carry on!!!! Has anyone else suffered the same type of symptoms??

{"id":"Endo_6gobxc_0","text":"So. Long journey, please bear with me.        \nBack in November, i had ( what i now know was) an endometrial cyst rupture and put me in the hospital for 3 days. No surgeries were done, they just monitored me and drugged me the whole time. I followed up with that doctor, we'll call him Dr. Dick, and had to keep insisting that there was still something terribly wrong. (Nonstop pain) He kept me on various pain killers and birth controls and then finally in February, he agreed to do surgery. That's when he found that i had endo. One of my ovaries was shot, so he took that, along with my tubes (i don't want kids).  When I followed up with him and asked about the endo and what that means, and how it might effect my life, Dr. Dick said \"it won't\" and that was the end of it. So after I was all healed up, i started feeling similar pains on the side that I still has an ovary. I got a scan and Dr. Dick said basically \"Yeah there's another cyst but it's probably unrelated so you're fine.\" and then that was the end of it.        \nSo that's when I found this sub, and then Nancy's nook, and then a really awesome doctor, we'll call him Dr. O'Cool. So my husband and I go to my first appointment with Dr. O'Cool and he literally talks with us for an hour and a half! I don't think I'd talked to Dr. Dick for that much time in total over 6 months. Anyway, he talked to us about everything endo related and answered all of our questions. He took a look around and saw that my uterus was immoble which was causing my pain (which was nonstop). We assured him that we absolutely do not want kids and if we change our minds in the future, we'd actually prefer to adopt. So he said he'd do excision, a hysterectomy, appendectomy, and with my family history, the gallbladder might also need to go. I told him if the other ovary is screwed up, he can take that too.  Basically i said he could take anything I don't need to live, but definitely take anything that has been or will cause me pain. Like i said, the pain was nonstop basically from November.       \nSo my surgery was on the first and, man he cleaned up shop! Uterus, appendix, gallbladder, ovary, and while he was in there, he did a bladder suspension to prevent me from needing one later.  My mom was like \"He can do that?! Why couldn't they have done that with MY hyst?!\"          \nThe surgery went great, and he did an awesome job of getting the gas out before closing me up. I had almost NO gas pain so that was awesome. A couple of days after surgery i seemingly wet the bed... Twice!  I was awake for the second time and it was totally uncontrollable and seemed to be coming out of my vagina. So i texted Dr. O'Cool (yes he gave me his cell number) and even though it was a Sunday, he told me to go ahead and go to the ER and he'd see me there. They ran tests, did scans, and figured out that i had an abscess. And Dr. O'Cool said i was on the verge of getting really sick so it was a really good thing i came in. They got me on antibiotics, put a drain in me and kept me for a few days until my fever stayed down. They're gonna look at the drain tomorrow to see if it's time to come out. Even with all that, i feel 10x better than i did 10 days after the last surgery. My bruising is way less, I'm in less pain, and generally just feeling better. I feel super confident that this shit has finally been taken care of.        \nTldr; don't go to a doctor you don't feel confident with.

My cycles were also becoming more painful, where they weren't that bad after having been on continuous BC for 6 years. Two months on BC to treat the endometrioma and it didn't shrink. With insurance, it made more sense to get the surgery before the end of the year, take the cyst, and start again with IUI in January. Well, that plan went to shit. Went in to the surgery expecting to start treatments again, came out discussing hysterectomy. Left ovary is shot. She couldn't get the whole cyst without taking the ovary. Right tube was adhered to my appendix, left tube was adhered to my bowel. Deep implants on pelvic wall and implants on my bowels.

{"id":"Endo_5vvovj_0","text":"I'll keep this as brief as possible. 2.5 years ago I went through 3 rounds of Lupron after a lap. I had horrible symptoms including suicidal thoughts, severe dizziness, and awful fatigue, which eventually led to me starting Zoloft 100mg. I gained 85lbs within the 5 months following my last injection even though I was eating low carb, low fat, gluten free paleo and actively doing yoga. I cut out dairy entirely, and eventually went vegan about 2 years ago. I'm not as active as I used to be but I eat hc/lf vegan, around 1200 calories a day with no gluten, very few grains and fats, no oils, nothing processed. Pretty much everything I eat is an unprocessed fruit or vegetable. I still have pretty bad endo symptoms and my periods are gradually getting worse, and I haven't lost any of the weight that I gained after Lupron. In fact, I recently started the same contraceptive that I took before Lupron and it seems to be causing me to gain more weight. I've been to too many doctors with the same bandaid solutions. Take your opiates for the pain, have another surgery, go on anti-depressants, etc. I have routine health exams to make sure I don't have any deficiencies and on paper, everything about my health is superb, except my weight.

I told her I'd also been putting it off because I've been really nervous about it and already had an idea of what it could be. I explained that I had developed Melasma about 2 years ago and was just diagnosed with it the month before. Explained that it may have occurred due to a hormonal imbalance. Then I went into full detail with everything I have experienced with my menstrual cycle during the last 4-5 years. I explained how I usually have 5-days of spotting before my period begins. I explained how bad my cramps can get, and how Advil and Midol don't help. The pain is sometimes debilitating, but I have just dealt with it. Once, a few years ago, I was experiencing such awful cramps that I broke out in a cold sweat and next thing I remembered was waking up on my bathroom floor covered in sweat. Then this last Fall of 2017, I woke up one night because I started having bad menstrual cramps. Went to the restroom, and then it hit me out of nowhere. Excruciating cramps, to the point I became disoriented and almost felt like I was going to pass out. I knew I needed to get back to my bed, and some how I managed to stumble back, but I just collapsed on to the bed. It woke up my partner who quickly realized something was very wrong. I remember her asking me what was wrong and not being able to really respond because of the pain. The only word I managed to get out was, \"cramps\". I laid there in the fetal position, covered in a cold sweat. She quickly grabbed the heating pad for my back, and a cold rag for my forehead. She made me take some Midol, but the cramps were not subsiding. 20 minutes into this excruciating pain, the possibility of calling 911 was suggested. Thankfully, my cramps began to slowly subside from excruciating pain to bearable pain.  I was able to talk again, and I just laid there in exhaustion from the pain I had just experienced.

{"id":"Endo_8zlrzo_0","text":"For those of you that have been following my journey I thought I'd update. For those of you with interest in Mayo Clinic this is also for you! So I'm hanging around Scottsdale/ Phoenix in Arizona. They have several notable excision surgeons here and all of them have been trained by Dr. Megrina who is partially retired. I chose Dr. Meghan Wasson and had my consult with her last week. She was extremely kind, intelligent and willing to answer all my questions. She says she's handled several cases of Sciatic Endometriosis and feels comfortable removing it using the da Vinci robot. She confirmed that I had an endometrioma on my ovary and said she's only had to remove 4 ovaries in her career, seems optimistic that my ovary will be fixed and work as normal. She agreed to place the mirena while I'm under and said it shouldn't be a problem as she's only seen a few women who truly can't fit the mirena.

I\u2019ve been putting this decision off for 4 months now, doing research and browsing this sub, but this week, the pain was so intense I couldn\u2019t move, again. I missed more work, again. I\u2019m not even menstruating, it\u2019s the ovulation pain I\u2019m feeling, at least that\u2019s what I was told by the OBGYN 4 months ago when she gave me these options. So. Here\u2019s my story.  As TLDR as I can make it:\nI started menstruation at an early age and at first I\u2019d bleed for weeks, have a week off, and start again. I became extremely anemic among other issues.  Eventually I was put in oral bc. Although I struggled with period related issues for many years I don\u2019t remember the pain being unbearable until I was 15-16. By time I was 20, the doctors had tested me for every G I issued under the sun.  I had been in the ER more times then I can count with complaints of pain.  Had a few small ovarian cysts come and go. A doctor had said it was endo but nothing was confirmed.  Tried a few different types of orals contraceptives. Had my gall balder and appendix removed, they were not functioning correctly and had massive amounts of scar tissue. During this procedure, and obgyn resident was present and reported back that I had no signs of endo, apparently the explored while they were in there.   Needless to say when the pain came back. Went on the depo, gained 40 lbs and still was in pain.  Stoped depo after the 2 shot (6 months) and just quit hormone medication completely.  \nDuring that time (23-25) my period settled down and actually became regular.  Pain was there but only during peak days.  I felt like a normal girl. I was also living healthier and eating healthier.  So that helped too. Then. The pelvic pain and nausea slowly started back in and now I\u2019m in unbearable pelvic and right hip pain some days.  And mostly bearable all other days.  Went into the MD when, among other symptoms, the pain became constant all month. She recommended mirana or implanon.  I hate both options, but as I sit here wasting another day on the couch and missing work, I realize I need to do SOMETHING.

{"id":"Endo_a85yv4_0","text":"I went on visanne almost 3 months ago now, and for the second week (October 18) I had terrible cramps in the morning that progressed to the worst pain I had ever felt. It seemed to start early in the morning, like 5am and wake me up in the middle of sleep. And then after that terrible day i hadn't had the pain again, until December 8th. So almost two months went by and I thought the visanne was working, until recently. The pain on December 8th was excruciating, I rarely cry over pain and I've felt severe pain many times but this time I was just crying in bed for hours. It started in the exact same way, early in the morning and progressing to a terrible sharp pain that I felt in my pelvis and vagina, almost like something was slicing/being ripped out of me. And then after a few hours it just went away. Then on the 19th of December the exact same thing happened. This is the only time I've ever had this kind of pain, its not comparable to other pain I've had from endo. And ever since being on visanne, other than these instances, I've had significantly less 'everyday' pain like I usually had before. Has anyone else ever had their pain show patterns? Do you think visanne could be causing it since I started right after I started taking it? This is the only time I've ever noticed any similarities in my pain. Also, I hadn't had a period since taking it, and neither of these times lined up with when I should have gotten one.

{"id":"Endo_e03ulv_0","text":"Not exactly sure what I should title this but I'm not looking for anyone to diagnose me or anything I just want to know I'm not alone. I'm 18 almost 19 and have had the textbook endo symptoms since I was 11/12 (got my period at 9). I would bleed through giant grandma pads in half an hour with giant clots and stuff. Went to the doctor and the solution was birth control. Started on the regular 3 week on one week off pill till I was about 15 and was put on the continuous non stop pill to help constant cramps and break through bleeding.\n It helped for awhile but around a year/2 years ago I started getting break though bleeding all the time again. I've been switched to many different pills and its only gotten worse. Ive had horrible digestive system problems this whole time and sometimes anal bleeding  and have had a colonoscopy with no results. My gynecologist told me that I couldnt have endometriosis if I had pains outside my period and that \"18 was too young to develop it anyways\". I'm getting so lost and confused in everything. \nI've been seeing my family care regular doctor for almost everything since the gyno doesnt think theres anything wrong with me. Ive had a pap smear, ultrasounds, 5 different types of birth control pills, blood tests and everything seems to be normal hormonally. Nothing can explain my constant cramps/vaginal pain and bleeding.\n However in the past 6 I've lost a lot of weight (210 pounds to 150) and am now constantly on my period. Every single day I have horrible cramps, aches, period shits the whole deal. My doctor thinks that I'm just hormonally off which makes sense but we've been trying different pills and it's only gotten worse. She suggest I try getting an IUD and suggest skyla. I'm a virgin so it terrifies me but if it's what I have to do to stop this constant bleeding than I guess its necessary. Also not sure if this is really connected but I've developed TMJ recently and my doctor thinks that it could be related to an overall inflammation problem possibly endometriosis (my family doctor not the gyno)\nSo I'm posting here to see if anyone has had a similar journey. I just feel so lost and confused after having the gyno tell me I was over reacting and that I was too young to have problems (she even treated me like a little kid and had me hold a plush uterus and explain to me what it was) to having my family doctor suggest I have endo but not want to investigate it and go for the IUD.\n Has anyone had constant bleeding and cramping and gotten the IUD for it? Or just had improved symptoms on the IUD? Or many just had off hormone problems for years and got over it somehow? I'm so lost and confused and feel alone.

I had been to this gyno previously because I had abnormal cells show up on my pap and has to get them frozen off my cervix. Anyways, I get an ultrasound and receive my results. The doctor saw something weird and didn\u2019t know what it was. He said it could be adenomyosis or some sort of growth. So I went for another ultrasound and they booked me for an MRI. After both of those I went back to the gyno and he said there was nothing there, maybe a small spot of endo on one Fallopian tube. After my first visit to my GP she prescribed me the lowest hormonal birth control you can get (Lolo). It helped for awhile but since then I just feel physically ill and am in pain. The gyno asked me how my pain was and just told me to stay on my birth control. I get severe anxiety and it doubles when I am on hormonal birth control.
