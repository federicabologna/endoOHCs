It started out by knocking me down for a day, now then progressed to pain for a minimum of 36hrs. I alternate between ibuprofen, Tylenol and muscle relaxers every 3hrs and it barely touches the pain. I\u2019ll be in tears, pacing, bent over, nauseous, pain down the leg, lower back, abdominal and vulva\u2026. Feeling like someone has reached inside and twisting and stabbing. It happens every 28days, so I know it\u2019s ovulation related. But now, I\u2019m having lower abdominal pain (much milder), some pain in the vulva, and even a little leg pain, days after ovulation. It\u2019s been 7 days since I ovulated and I\u2019m still experiencing this. I was also reading that diarrhea and constipation are also common signs, which I experience on a fairly regular basis. I have an IUD, so I don\u2019t have a period. I have recently started having some minor cramps though around the time that I would have a period. I will also occasionally have cramps after orgasm, but that\u2019s not been consistent. I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out if any of this sounds consistent with endo?

{"id":"endometriosis_ni1o61","text":"I have been lurking here for a few months, reading so many posts, and I am truly in awe of all of you warriors.   \n\n\nThe reason I am finally posting is that I have an upcoming laparoscopic surgery using the DaVinci robot booked in the next couple of months, and I am feeling anxious about everything.   \n\n\nSo some background information that I think is relevant, I started my period when I was 11, and as far as I can remember back I had pretty severe cramping during my period, but in my early twenties, they got more and more manageable with the extent of my period pain now being on day 1 and 2, and all I need to do is take 1 ES Tylenol, and I am good to proceed with my regular day to day life. However, I did have terrible chronic lower back pain for a few years and was diagnosed with an 18 cm fibroid which was removed via an open myomectomy (vertical incision) last year. I lost a shit ton of blood, had to have a transfusion and stayed 3 nights in the hospital and had a pretty rough recovery. \n\nI am a lesbian, married to my wife for 3 years now, and we wanted to start growing our family, so a few months after my surgery, I started to see a Reproductive Endroconoligst in hopes of becoming pregnant. He did a Saline Sono and full hormone panel. After the Saline Sono, they did tell me that my right ovary appeared to be stuck to the back of the uterus and may be inaccessible if we needed to do IVF. I asked why or how, and they told me they didn't know, but it could be due to scarring from my myomectomy. But all my research online said that it could be endometriosis; when I brought that up to them, they told me it could be, but you need surgery to determine that 100% and basically deterred me from that option. I ended up doing 3 unmedicated/monitored IUI's, and all were unsuccessful.   \n\n\nI moved on to a new RE Clinic, and I requested my notes from the Saline Sono, and that's when I learned that I had adenomyosis on the back of my uterus. This was never disclosed to me and came as a huge shock. Again, I researched adenomyosis, and I found that often if you have that, you also have endometriosis. So when I went to the new clinic, they reviewed all my test results and sent me for an HSG test, which came back normal. So I was still confused as to why that tube was stuck and asked my new RE about the possibility of endo, and she said yes, it could be, but you'll need a lap to diagnose 100% and basically again deterred me from that route. So I proceeded with 2 Medicated and Monitored IUI's, producing between 2 - 3 follicles and still no success. So at this point, we were looking at IVF, and it was just unsettling to me that I would undergo a very costly and emotionally draining cycle of IVF with no explanation as to why my ovary was stuck to the back of my uterus.   \n\n\nI decided to reach out to the surgeon who performed my myomectomy and asked her if she recalled seeing any issues with my uterus or ovaries, any signs of endo or the ovary being stuck. She said she didn't and provided me with her surgical report. \n\nSo before doing any more fertility treatments, I decided to press pause and sought out an endo specialist in my area. I found a doctor who does perform excision surgeries but isn't listed on nancys nook, the only one I found on there from my state is now retired. I met with him this week, and we went over my records, and he said, let's do surgery and try and figure this out. I was kind of surprised he came to that decision so quickly, despite my lack of endo symptoms. He said he occasionally sees silent endo in his patients, and I very well could have it, and if I don't, he will do his best to free the ovary so that if I need IVF, at least I will have both accessible. I asked him why the surgeon who did my myomectomy didn't see anything, and he said doing that type of surgery is very difficult to visualize endo.   \n\n\nSo anyway, I am sorry for this ridiculously long post, and if any of you are still reading this, I just wanted to get your feedback and advice. Would you proceed with the lap despite having no symptoms besides the adenomyosis and the ovary stuck? Also, if anyone reading this has silent endo and had excision surgery, I would love to hear your stories and feedback.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/ni1o61/unsure_about_upcoming_lap_surgery/","_input_hash":-1146732235,"_task_hash":742826450,"options":[{"id":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","text":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS","text":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS","text":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"DISBELIEF","text":"DISBELIEF"},{"id":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","text":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE"},{"id":"DIAGNOSIS","text":"DIAGNOSIS"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"choice","accept":["PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept"}

{"id":"endometriosis_pn7o1z","text":"Hi. \n\nI have a family history of endometriosis and I periodically get a lil stressed about it because it seems to be so common/undiagnosed, even in people with clear red flag symptoms. I'm on Yaz right now, and aside from the 2 weeks of continuous spotting every now and then (basically, anytime I'm even a little late taking my BC) my period is generally under control. Which is fine, but, it does sketch me out that no one has been able to explain what happened to me/why stuff currently happens to me aside from prostaglandins.\n\nI had my first period at 11, and my second and third at 12 and 13, about 10 months apart, with about 18 days of heavy bleeding, and cramping so severe I could barely move. Just got told to take 3 ibuprofen at a time and that was it. I got slightly more regular as a teenager, with 7 days of bleeding, usually every 35 days, but sometimes more like 46-162 days. Accompanied by pretty rough pain and nausea the first two days, but I only left school once because of cramping. \n\nI'm 23 now, last year the nausea progressed to vomiting the day ahead of my period. I've never had that level of nausea in my life unless I'm extremely drunk, so it was bizarre. That's when I started the Yaz, cos essentially it felt like I had the flu for a week like 4-5 times a year and I was fucking over it. Oh, and sometime around 19-20 I got diagnosed with PMDD, which I take an antidepressant continuously for.\n\nI've had GI issues since I was about 18, and they get NOTABLY worse whenever my body decides to bleed, which also seems to be a relatively common experience among people with Endo. \n\nI have joint hypermobility which sometimes gets notably worse during withdrawal bleeds. \n\nMy symptoms are mostly fine now that I'm taking yaz continuously, aside from the fact that my uterus obeys no hormones and does what it wants re: bleeding and cycle lengths.\n\nI know it's totally possible to have real bad scarring but no pain, or barely any scarring and tons of pain, but I guess I'm trying to figure out how abnormal my baseline is, and if it's worth pursuing further beyond just taking BC.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/pn7o1z/how_did_your_menses_start_were_they_abnormal_or/","_input_hash":208251568,"_task_hash":-921813172,"options":[{"id":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","text":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS","text":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS","text":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"DISBELIEF","text":"DISBELIEF"},{"id":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","text":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE"},{"id":"DIAGNOSIS","text":"DIAGNOSIS"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"choice","accept":["UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept"}

{"id":"Endo_nm7utq","text":"Hey all, I've been here for years. Diagnosed endo when I was in my late teens, almost 30 now.\n\nYesterday I experienced something new and awful for the first time.\n\nI had my regular cramping pain come on. Nothing new or unusual, just very severe and bad cramps in my uterus, regular pain for us. Enough that I was bending over and holding my uterus. I had to pee, so I went on the toilet, and my entire uterus just contracted. I've had that sort of tight contraction pain before, almost like somebody is just grabbing and squishing my uterus up into a ball. But it was ROUGH.\n\nI felt like I was going to have diarrhea as well, my butt kind of went into that muscle feeling as though it was happening, but nothing was coming out. I was dripping sweat, felt like I was going to pass out, my vision went white. My uterus was just totally stuck like that and it wasn't doing anything else, same with my bum. I had a cold towel covering my thighs, one on the back of my neck and one for my face. Any time we'd switch them out, the \"cold\" towel would just be incredibly hot and you couldn't even tell it had been soaked in wet water. Sweat was rolling down between my boobs and stomach and off my face.\n\nI ended up taking .5 of a lorazepam as well as naproxen and tylenol and just stayed sitting on the toilet like that for maybe 30 mins. I just could not move. I never ended up having an actual BM, my muscles just stayed like I was about to have diarrhea for the entire time. Once the medication combo I had started working, I could legit feel my muscles start to relax, felt the dizziness pass, and my body cooled down. I waited until I could stand up and had a nice shower and from there, I just had slight pain for the rest of the night and I'm feeling fine (or endo fine lmao) again.\n\nWhat the fuck happened? Has anybody else experienced something like this before? I have had pain while peeing and having a BM before, usually when I feel either one of those coming on or WHILE it is occurring, but nothing like this. It was also interesting because even though I was sitting on the toilet that entire time, and my behind muscles were basically stuck MID bowel movement, nothing came out. I just had a regular pee once it was all over and my body had relaxed.\n\nMy mom and bf were there and said it looked awful, my mom straight up said that looked and sounded like basically a 30 min labour lmao. I don't know...it's just strange having all of the regular shitty symptoms and feeling like you're an old pro, and then having something new and awful happen to screw you up.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/nm7utq/uterus_stuck_in_acontraction/","_input_hash":-1131212655,"_task_hash":-2084852313,"options":[{"id":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","text":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS","text":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS","text":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"DISBELIEF","text":"DISBELIEF"},{"id":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","text":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE"},{"id":"DIAGNOSIS","text":"DIAGNOSIS"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"choice","accept":["ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept"}

{"id":"endometriosis_nk02m1","text":"Might get a little too descriptive.\n\nI'm currently 27. My periods have always sucked, also PMDD so that sucks too. Prozac and bc when I was in high school. Quit taking the bc after graduation because I was having aura migraines and my doctor thought that could be causing it, haven't had them since 2011. \n\n2012: Had Mirena put in in November, bad experience, had it taken out January 2013 and ended up in the er because I was hemorrhaging from my uterus. No bc after, couldn't remember to take the pill.\n\nFirst lap in 2014 because sex hurt and my periods were awful. Only findings were a cyst, fibroids, and a retroverted uterus, put in the report \"possible early signs of endometriosis\" and I wouldn't have even known about that without getting all of my records because they didn't even mention it to me. \n\nSeptember 2018: I started getting really nauseous and had like pieces of tissue coming out of me (similar to if you bite the extra skin off your cheek), bleeding with sex, pain during, and cramping after. Went in for an exam and everything hurt and my doctor said \"you definitely have endometriosis\" \n\nSwitched doctors after that.\n\nOctober 2018: Laparoscopy after first appt to confirm endo. Said I have an adhesion on my left side and something about an Allen Masters window, and a small cyst they just left alone. Put on bc and eventually Orlissa.\n\nStarted bc with a period every month, then they told me to just skip my bleed week because it hurt too much, then the one with a period every 3 months also to skip it if I had too much pain but I'd start spotting and they told me to just stop for a few days and bleed for a couple days then continue it. I went off it for a few months last year because I was tired of the side effects and my work shut down so I didn't have to be physically there, but then got back on the one with a bleed week every month. I've been spotting for the last like 2 months, usually brown but sometimes pinkish/red. Clots too. And during my period I have decent sized clots.\n\nSex is also basically impossible. \n\nMy last exam was April 12th and hurt like hell. They said my cervix was crooked and didn't know if the endo was pulling it or something and schedule an ultrasound. Ultrasound said my ovaries looked perfect, no cysts or anything alarming, switched my bc to Lo Loestrin so my ovaries wouldn't activate at all and said come back in June and schedule another laparoscopy if it's not better. But even having the full bladder for the ultrasound killed me for like 3-4 days. The pain is extra intense if I have to pee.\n\nI'm almost done with my first week of the new bc. Spotting has stopped for now. I'm nauseous 27 days out of the month and throw up at least twice a week, but I also have a bunch of neck issues and carpal tunnel--plus I broke my toe a couple weeks ago but it only hurts now if I hit it or I'm walking for a while-- so idk if the nausea is from my endo by itself or just all the pain in general.\n\nIt feels like my ovaries are on fire, I have \"normal\" cramps basically all the time, occasionally stabby cramps and I'll blow up like a balloon randomly with worse stabby cramps that don't stop until I deflate. Any gas and it becomes unbearable very quickly, specifically on my left side. I've already maxed out on taking Orlissa so that's not an option anymore. My doctor only does ablations and told me after my laparoscopy in 2018 that I had endo but I didn't have endo that they could treat, only manage the symptoms and I didn't know enough about it back then to even know what he was talking about. I record all of my dr visits and listened to it again and I wanna smack myself for not switching doctors after that. But it's also been \"manageable\" until recently. I asked about a hysterectomy before but was told I was too young and since its not a guaranteed fix that they won't even consider it.\n\nIbuprofen and Midol do nothing now. I've tried eating turmeric, not sure if it did much though. I take muscle relaxers when I go to bed (for my neck but at least it knocks me out sometimes). I have kratom, CBD, delta-8 and normal weed so I can make myself eat because it's basically impossible otherwise. \n\nI have an appt on June 25th with a specialist I found from Nancy's Nook and I'm on the wait list for any sooner openings. I just don't know what to do for it until then because that's forever away and the only thing that does anything for the pain is heat, and even with that it's far from ideal, and once the heat stops it gets worse again. I sleep with my heating pad just about every night, and I've even put the toasty toes on the inside of my work uniform so I can at least function.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/nk02m1/pain_management_or_other_advice/","_input_hash":970538532,"_task_hash":1672694940,"options":[{"id":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","text":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS","text":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS","text":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"DISBELIEF","text":"DISBELIEF"},{"id":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","text":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE"},{"id":"DIAGNOSIS","text":"DIAGNOSIS"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"choice","accept":["ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","TREATMENT SYMPTOMS"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept"}

{"id":"endometriosis_p7h9m6","text":"I had a laparoscopy on the 15th July. After the surgery I was told - They definitely had found a 10cm cyst on one ovary, which they removed a fair amount of and deflated. From what I can remember the gynecologist telling me / what she showed me in photos -  The other ovary was barely visible as the fallopian tube is around it and the ovary is stuck to my bowel. My gynecologist then referred me to a specialist for endometriosis. \n\nI had a letter since to say the biopsy confirmed endometriosis &amp; that it is severe. However, I've not had any further information up until this point. \n\nI went for the consultation today with the specialist. Firstly, they did not have any of the information from the surgery or the photos. The two hospital are merging, but still haven't with their IT system. My consultant said he had seen the surgery results though whilst at the other hospital, but openly admitted he has over 70 patients so he can't remember it exactly.\n\nHe then proceeds to explain how there is two options, either to have surgery or not. He had said if my symptoms are manageable with the contraceptive pill, then it may not be worth having the surgery. I explained I've had many issues with the pill (from causing vomiting to extreme mood swings). I agreed with his sentiment, but I had just filled out a form showing on a degree of 1-10 about all my symptoms, so it was quite clear that I haven't been managing. He didn't explicitly say that was the only option, but it felt like he was pushing that to begin with.\n\nHe then pulls up my previous MRI and reads the information from that, showing a 7cm cyst on one ovary and 3cm on the other - which is incorrect compared to the actual results of the surgery. I had to point out that the MRI was taken from before the surgery. He agreed, and then said OK we need to get a 2nd MRI. \n\nIt felt like he was then going to leave the conversation there, with him booking the MRI and seeing me in 3 months time. I have been very anxious for this consultation, because other than the surgery, its the first time I've had a face to face consultation. I ended up crying at this moment out of frustration. \n\nHe was OK with me for that part, and then explained via a diagram where abouts the endometriosis abrasions are between my ovary &amp; bowel. He explained that during the surgery they were unable to see how deep those abrasions will be, so they need the MRI to try to get as much information as possible. He told me that they would need the bowel specialist &amp; other specialist to look over the MRI too.  This is, according to him, because if I was to require bowel surgery, they need to work out the potential risk of me then requiring a stoma after the surgery. \n\n\nSo I now have to wait 3 months until my next consultation with him. I understand now why the MRI is now required. However, I partly feel angry, because if they were aware from the surgery that they needed this further information, why didn't they ask my permission for the MRI, instead of wasting time with this consultation.

{"id":"Endo_mjlmw4","text":"For a long time now, I've been thinking that it would be useful to write down my symptoms, at least when I had flare ups, to see if there's a connection or a timing, and to have some info for the doctors. Not just \"sometimes I feel good and sometimes I don't\" but the actual data.\n\nBut I just hate the very thought of it! I can't. When I'm feeling good, I don't want to think that I will feel bad again. And when I'm feeling bad, I just want it all to end. I've been dodging this idea for years.\n\nIt would probably be helpful in that to know what to do and when it usually ends, which pre-symptoms are a warning etc. But alas. I don't even know the exact date I've been taking pills from (but I can deduct it if I need to), I don't know when I changed pills, I don't remember which year my lap was. I remember that I had been feeling bad but don't remember the exact symptoms. \n\nI started thinking about it when I remembered what the current flare up reminds me of. Back in who knows which year, before I was diagnosed with endo, I was having a flare up and was diagnosed with IBS.

{"id":"endometriosis_ksmrpm","text":"Hello lovely people,\n\nI had an MRI done recently that suggested the presence of endo. The consultant said it was likely I had it, paired with my pain symptoms, so started me on the combined pill (the mini pill gave me awful side effects).

The covid symptoms have more or less resolved but the reflux, especially at night, is still there.

{"id":"Endo_l14u2z","text":"I wanted to share my first robotic laparoscopic myomectomy experience (took place today) in hopes of calming anyone looking to get this surgery. The purpose of my surgery was to remove a massive fibroid and to clean up some endo. I have the standard five incisions but mine are higher up on the belly (nothing near hips). Not sure if that\u2019s the standard robotic ports but I assumed they\u2019d be slightly lower. \n\nI remember when I scheduled my surgery in November, I stopped sleeping and memorized every single post, tip, piece of advice etc found on both Reddit and Glow app. Long story short, it was nowhere near as scary as I made it seem. Below are some bullets of where I currently am, a day post-op. I know not all experiences are the same and I felt like I read the really complicated ones which was good because I felt prepared for it all. There are so many warriors on this channel and I, at best, feel like I\u2019m worthy of a participation trophy for my garden-variety experience. Here\u2019s a recap:\n\nSurgery prep: I read on Reddit that someone exercised and got into great shape before their procedure and I couldn\u2019t agree more that this has helped me the MOST. If you are able to, I highly recommend arm and leg workouts leading up to surgery. I\u2019m much more mobile because of it and am able to get around with only a bit of discomfort. \n\nAnxiety management: I have TERRIBLE anxiety. The weeks leading up to the surgery I was in rare form. What helped was organizing myself and creating \u201cstations\u201d throughout my house with Tylenol and things I felt like would be useful to me. I prepped the day before and it made me calm and somehow I slept through the night with no issues. \n\nPain level: completely manageable. I was prescribed opioids and OTC meds and have not even bothered looking at the opioids. I took two Tylenol and have been fine, and I took them about 8 hours apart and in that down time, I didn\u2019t feel much pain at all. The best way to describe it is as if you did a million crunches. I do feel my incisions though but it\u2019s not the worst. No cramping giving the amount of work that was done to my uterus so I\u2019m wondering if I got a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card on this one. \n\nCar ride home: I looked like the Michelin man with all the pillows I had but didn\u2019t feel any discomfort at all (I live in NYC where there\u2019s a pothole every 3 inches). Great to have padding between seatbelt and your belly though. \n\nGas pain: I haven\u2019t met any gas pain (yet). Some brief twinges of gas here and there in my shoulder but completely manageable. I also walked a lot after surgery and have been farting up a storm (sorry tmi)\n\nScars: will update this eventually but I got 5 incisions - 4 on my upper belly and one in belly button. I was very worried my career as a bikini model would be over (joking) but it\u2019s really not that bad. This was a concern of mine and was upsetting me but it\u2019s really not a big deal. I\u2019m actually proud of these scars and am so excited to finally not look so bloated all the time!\n\nAppetite: I was worried I wouldn\u2019t eat but I have appetite and ate a turkey sandwich at the hospital. I have anti nausea meds, haven\u2019t used them (hopefully won\u2019t). I did have anti-nausea meds in my IV drip and I think that helped. \n\nMobility: slow and steady wins the race. The rumors are true, it SUCKS to get up and down but walking is fine for me since my cuts are centered around my upper belly, I feel like I can lean on my lower belly a bit more. \n\nSleeping: can\u2019t sleep on my back and am definitely a stomach sleeper hence why the long post at 3am EST. :-) I know that this too shall pass. \n\nSome random call outs:\n- no bowel movement yet and frankly I am terrified given how tender everything is. I have a \u201chealthy\u201d digestive system so will start Miralax tomorrow and hope for the best.\n- I already feel a emptiness from where the fibroid was an am SHOCKED at how much mass I had inside of me. Good riddance, fibroid weirdo!!!\n- My surgery ended up being longer than expected and was down for 5 hours - that said, my body was not waking up fast enough afterwards and I needed a Foley catheter to void. I didn\u2019t go home with one though and have been urinating normally. This was my top fear and it was realized and I was pleasantly surprised at how... fine it was. Yes, it sucks to a degree but it\u2019s so fast that it is not even a big deal. I found a uterine biopsy to me more painful but that\u2019s just me!\n- I was terrified of anesthesia. This was my first surgery and going under was so scary to me. Anesthesiologists are incredible people and I cried when I met mine and she immediately gave me a \u201cmargarita\u201d and next thing I know, I\u2019m waking up to a turkey sandwich. \n- What I found to be The Worst about this is the anxiety and fear of the unknown. The nerves before the surgery were worse than anything else. I reminded myself, \u201cwhat matters most is how well you walk through the fire\u201d\n\nIf you have any other questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. So many of you were kind and opened up to me about your experiences and it\u2019s because of YOU I didn\u2019t run for the hills yesterday. I\u2019d like to pay it forward and help anyone else who may be consumed with fear over this very ordinary, safe and life changing (for the better) procedure.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/l14u2z/my_first_robotic_lap_experience/","_input_hash":-1120229795,"_task_hash":-1197417535,"options":[{"id":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","text":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS","text":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS","text":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"DISBELIEF","text":"DISBELIEF"},{"id":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","text":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE"},{"id":"DIAGNOSIS","text":"DIAGNOSIS"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"choice","accept":["TREATMENT SYMPTOMS"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept"}

{"id":"endometriosis_oglhz0","text":"Hey everyone, \n\nI've had left side pelvic pain (F 27) for 3-4 years now that hasn't been diagnosed. I haven't gone to any specialist about it, just my GP and hospital visits. \n\nWhen I had my IUD inserted (removed now), pretty soon after I had very intense left sided pelvic pain, I went to the hospital and they told me my left fallopian tube inflamed, and that the IUD strings gravitated into my uterus. I had no infection, my blood work came back great, and so they did more ultrasounds a few days later and the swelling went down. Desperate, I begged for a course of antibiotics, I obviously had it removed, but the pain never subsided. All my ultrasounds come back as healthy. \n\nThe pain feels more like an irritation now, maybe a dull tight pain you could say. Sometimes it's worse than other times, and it almost feels like it radiates down my leg. I need to massage around my inner hip bone and shake my leg hard and fast to relieve it when it's bad. \n\nIt feels like the inner pelvic muscles around my left fallopian tube are all very, very tense and spasmed almost, and constantly by the way. It never is fully relaxed, it just varies in intensity. Sometimes it's just a dull pressure I can ignore, other times it drives me crazy to the point I've even gotten drunk to just relax my muscles and get my mind off of the tightness and discomfort. \n\nAny thoughts anyone can share that could help would be life changing for me.

{"id":"endometriosis_o7drie","text":"So something strange has happened. \n\nAbout a month and a bit ago I decided to go off synthetic hormones. The decision took ages but essentially I\u2019m doing it both for mental health but also because I have some odd vascular things happening. Long story and not really important :) \n\nI was expecting the worst tbh. I\u2019d be having my first \u201creal\u201d period in years and lord help me I know what that means. \n\nThing is, uh. It was nothing. And I\u2019m about 99.9% sure it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been taking antihistamines for almost three months now.

{"id":"Endo_p2h1ht","text":"Hey all. I was diagnosed with endometriosis though surgery back in 2010. I had an exploratory lap done and then a few weeks after that had an ablation done. Then I had another ablation done in 2012. I have not had many issues with it since then, managed to get pregnant in 2019 and had a (mostly) uneventful pregnancy and gave birth to my son at the end of 2019. However since giving birth to my son, it seems like my endo has gotten worse with recurring pain. It's usually not bad and I can power through it, and I'll have instances of pain that last for a few straight days and then go weeks or months without pain. I had an IUD placed back in November of 2020 and have not had any issues with it.\n\n Here within the last month, month and a half I have had such bad pain. I've had the positioning of my IUD checked twice via digital manipulation and via ultrasound and I've been told it's perfect. The pain is constant. hovering around 5-6/10 and sometimes as bad as 8/10. It doesn't favor either side but sometimes I do get pain in my lower back with it as well. The pain in my back is lower than where I had my epidural so I know it isn't residual back pain from my delivery, and I'm not sure why I would have pain this far out from that when I never had any issues with it before. The back pain only comes when the pain in my pelvic area ramps up. Sometimes it gets so back I can't breathe or speak. \n\nThe last time I went to the doctor, they told me to take ibuprofen prophylactically, even after I already told them I had been taking ibuprofen and naproxen constantly for my migraine headaches and it was beginning to make my stomach hurt AND it wasn't doing anything for my pain levels, and to try a course of antibiotics because \"we don't know why but sometimes it helps\". Well, I'm almost finished with the course of antibiotics and so far it hasn't done jack. The pain is worse now than when I scheduled the appointment, and I'm having bloating so bad I feel like I'm going to pop. When I was at the doctor, I asked what the next step was after trying the course of antibiotics and they said that it was likely an exploratory lap to see if there was any recurrence of endo.\n\nI do not want to have surgery. I have a very active lifestyle and a very active almost 2 year old who demands my attention and I cannot be laid up in bed for 6-8 weeks recovering. My husband is very busy and stressed at work and I cannot put the burden on him to take care of the household while I'm recovering from surgery. On top of all that, we're in the process of trying to buy a house and surgery would severely delay that as well. \n\nAll I want is to not be in pain any longer, or at least return the pain to a tolerable level like it was before. I want to be able to have more days without pain than with pain. I want to be able to have sex with my husband without having a week, week and a half, two week recovery period afterwards because the pain is so bad. I know from prior experience that surgery is not going to make this much better, and even if it was going to, I just can't make the time for the reasons mentioned above.\n\nI don't know if my doctor thinks I was drug-seeking and this is the reason they chose to recommend surgery over narcotics, but is there something special I need to do or say to get them to prescribe prescription pain medication? I already use CBD and delta 8 and it doesn't do much for my pain either. I use delta 8 every night before bed for sleep. Last night I smoked a lot before bed and was having an instance of 9/10 pelvic pain and the D8 didn't touch it.

{"id":"Endo_lcq91z","text":"So. \n\nBasically I have a number of health issues and a bunch can cause similar  symptoms.\n\nI currently have a urologist  and a gynaecologist.  They don't speak. \n\nGynaecologist has offered me surgery  and I've been putting off making a decision  but kind of need to now.  My last laparoscopy  was fine, they abated a small amount. Was told it wasn't enough to cause the pain I was in, yet after surgery  quite a bit of pain was gone. It was six months to the follow up appointment after a tonne of cancellations, to which point I had quite bad rectal bleeding, at which point I was told it absolutely  could not have been endo. \n\nCue a bunch of gastro appointments with them not finding any bleeding. Having my cased close, despite the fact in one of the days I had a sigmoidoscopy I had blood the morning of.\n\nNow moving from a rural area with no endo specialists to living somewhere in area with some amazing health care. I get a urologist,  a gynaecologist with endo specialty and a gastro doc.  Gastro have just signed me off saying they still can't find where the blood comes from, biopsies have come back benign.  \n\nHave urology and may end up with a catheter or having surgery, but have to stop taking bladder meds  which turns out were  likely numbing my bladder. But some of the pain  I'm having could well be caused by bladder strain. However, there's no way to know.\n\nThe gynaecologist  hasn't even questioned my symptoms and has offered surgery, saying things like he wants to look at the pouch of Douglas  etc. At this stage I'm almost feeling that the abdominal pain and the rectal bleeding (which I have no idea of its cyclical because of the mirena) seem to be my main symptoms.  \n\nNow, after my last gyno  treatment after surgery I'm a little worried.

{"id":"Endo_ko8vu5","text":"A little while ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/jukdg1/were_you_blindsided_by_your_endo_diagnosis/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) asking if anyone had been blindsided by their Endometriosis diagnosis. It was out of curiosity more than anything, as prior to the post I had never really considered that Endometriosis could be an issue for me. Peoples responses however made me wonder if Endometriosis was really the cause of my issues after all of these years..\n\nWell, I too was completely blindsided by my diagnosis just two weeks ago today, and I wanted to share my story and how I got to the point of diagnosis in hopes that it will help any other woman.\n\nBackground:\n\nAround 2015 I developed digestive issues. Bloating to the point I looked 8 months pregnant, diarrhoea one day and constipation the next, but it kind of happened in waves and didn't cause too much grief. I was on the birth control pill at this time and continued having 'flare ups' of these digestive issues for another 2 years before it really started bothering me. \n\nI eventually decided in December 2017 that I would go off the pill because I'd read a few research papers that indicated it could've been the pill making me feel this way. By this point I was in a serious relationship and we used condoms and tracked my cycle in order to be safe and not have any accidents now I wasn't on the pill. For about 12 months I would say my digestive symptoms settled. I definitely still felt off some days, but overall it wasn't affecting my life too much and I thought I'd gotten to the bottom of the problem.\n\nFast forward to beginning of 2019 my bloat and bowel movements were back and causing horrendous pain. I booked in to see a naturopath and she was a god send - she really helped minimise my symptoms and regulate my bowel movements, and overall I just felt the best I'd felt in years. By this point I had been diagnosed with IBS and lactose/gluten intolerance, so that is what we were trying to manage with vitamins/diet etc. I still flared up very often - bloating more than anything. \n\nCome to March 2020, my husband and I were ready to start trying for a baby. I'd been off the pill all these years, so we just got straight to it. I was tracking my cycle by taking my temperature every morning, doing ovulation tests, timing our sex during my fertile days perfectly. Month after month passed and no pregnancy. I started feeling like something wasn't right and after trying to conceive for 7 months I went to an OB/GYN. \n\nI am so grateful for my doctor that despite not trying to conceive for 12 months was willing to send me for a HyCoSy tubal patency test. This lead to the discovery that both of my Fallopian tubes are completely blocked. My doctor was lead to believe I had Endometriosis and we needed to do a Laparoscopy ASAP. Within two weeks I was having my surgery.\n\nMy doctor discovered Endometriosis all throughout my pouch of Douglas (explains years of bowel issues!!!!) and over my left and right uterosacral and round ligaments. As suspected, my Fallopian tubes are also completely scarred shut with Endometriosis.\n\nI am heartbroken. My lifelong dream of becoming a mother will only become a reality after enduring IVF, and I am devastated I was showing these digestive symptoms for so many years, that we now know was Endometriosis riddling my insides and causing my infertility.\n\nI never thought it could've been Endometriosis because I never presented with any of the 'standard' symptoms. No heavy periods, no painful periods, no cramping, no irregular cycles. Absolutely nothing. My cycles were only 3-5 days long and if I didn't have to change my tampon I wouldn't even know I was on my period.\n\nThe difference I feel after my Endometriosis excision two weeks ago is incredible. I never thought I'd see the day I didn't bloat to the point of a full term pregnancy. I feel the best I've felt in over 5 years. \n\nIf any of this resonates with you, please advocate for yourself and listen to your intuition.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/ko8vu5/i_was_completely_blindsided_by_my_endometriosis/","_input_hash":104508152,"_task_hash":-444426350,"options":[{"id":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","text":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS","text":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS","text":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"DISBELIEF","text":"DISBELIEF"},{"id":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","text":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE"},{"id":"DIAGNOSIS","text":"DIAGNOSIS"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"choice","accept":["ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","DIAGNOSIS"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept"}

{"id":"endometriosis_psrcee","text":"Last month I got a virus from my toddler that landed me in the ER with severe pain from the incessant coughing. I got a full hysterectomy with endo excision earlier this year so I am still healing, slowly but surely I hope. Alone in the exam room the doctor dismissed my pain, wouldn\u2019t review my chart when I told him I am already on narcotics daily for endometriosis, he then yelled at me \u201cno narcotics\u201d and stormed out of the room. I have never been yelled at like that by a man in a room before and it was terrifying especially given the vulnerable and painful state I was in. I truly only go to the ER when I can\u2019t take the pain anymore and my chart reflects that, it\u2019s not often that I need to go but typically whenever I get a virus my pelvic pain flares horribly. The ER denied my request for a different doctor who would actually review my chart so I left. I wrote a letter to the hospital to tell them of the incident and also informed them that I was in this position of having pain because after years of me going to the ER saying I was in pain and being told nothing was wrong by dismissive doctors when the whole time I had endometriosis causing damage which I am still trying to reverse and don\u2019t know if I will ever be able to. The letter they sent me back basically says due to privacy laws they can\u2019t tell me anything about what they did regarding the doctor and they assure me that they have shared this incident with their ER doctors. I just feel like it\u2019s not good enough and I honestly don\u2019t feel safe going to the ER again which is so scary because I have a toddler who most likely will get me sick again in the near future. I have to have accountability with taking my pain meds which my pain management doctor monitors because I actually need them to live a better quality life and it just seems like the ER doctors don\u2019t do enough digging to see me as a patient with endo actively going to pelvic physical therapy, getting surgery after surgery where they find the endo has returned each time is definitely not abusing pain medication because it\u2019s all documented, accounted for, and for legitimate pain which gets so bad I need further help at the ER from time to time. They just don\u2019t have the knowledge or awareness of just how bad endometriosis episodes are when they are REALLY bad. I am so tired of these men telling me that my pain is not significant enough to treat when this disease is so serious I lost my fertility because I was not treated or listened to early enough. Regardless, I went to a doctor for help and in return they yelled at me in one of my worst states and then lied on the ER discharge report about what happened and I just don\u2019t understand why nothing is done about this and it feels like it doesn\u2019t matter enough to people.

Not my idea of fun tho! \ud83d\ude29\n\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\n\nLast year, a 13-centimeter cyst next to the ovaries has showed up in my MRI and my gynecologist said she's pretty sure it's endometriosis. My CA-125 levels were high (480, I think? Haven't seen the reports in a while so idk if I'm getting the name of the test wrong) and I did other tumor marker tests too, all of them were normal.\n\nShe put me on birth control pills, told me that I'd have to get surgery, but I was really super depressed by that time so I stopped the treatment! \n\nAfter 2 months tho, the 13cm cyst decreased in size and the doc told me that although there's significant improvement, maybe I'd have to get the cyst biopsied? I didn't get it biopsied tho. She told me to do the cancer marker tests again, which I didn't do, because I didn't have money and I was suicidal too. I stopped having any abnormal symptoms tho. \n\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\n\nAnyways, so this month (11 months after the cyst thing) I **started my period around 22nd August.**  My periods are usually on time and last around 6-7 days. The same thing happened this time as well, I had them for 6-7 days and then they were over. \n\nAbout **two (ish) weeks after my period, I started having some discharge** -- always happens? Ovulation, I figured? -- and thought it would be okay in a few days. But the **amount of discharge was more than normal**?? It's happened to me though, there's so much discharge that my tummy starts hurting and hurts for days. This time, I had to change my undies every 2-3 hours because it would just ruin it all? I eventually started wearing pads for the discharge and wore them for 3-4 days. **The amount of discharge reduced after 4 days too, and I felt (unsure) that one day the color of the discharge was maybe pinkish/light brownish? but that was just one day!** I had a dull pain in the lower left side of my abdomen while I had the discharge. I also had a very low-grade fever for about 10 days with it! I just took some antibiotics and paracetamol.  \n\n\nI don't have either the pain or the fever now, but **today I spotted?** No periods, but spotting? Am I freaking out without any reason?

Oh, and the fact that I had my period for 102 consecutive days earlier this year. When I met with my surgeon for my consult, he looked over the chart from the gyno who referred me, asked a few more questions, confirmed that he definitely can tell I have PCOS, but also didn\u2019t think my cyst ruptures were traditional ovarian cyst ruptures. He said he was pretty positive I also have endo and that he would excise any he found while doing my hysterectomy.\n\nFast forward to a few hours ago when one of the gyno residents comes to my room to check in with me and fill me in on some of the details/findings of my surgery. When he got in there, my surgeon found unspecified adhesions on my left ovary, left tube, part of my colon, and my abdominal wall.

{"id":"Endo_kwzpde","text":"Hi all! I've been seriously suffering from endo for the past year and a half, but dealt with symptoms my whole life. I had surgery back in June, where some endo was removed from my pouch of Douglas, abdominal wall and below my uterus. As well, they removed a 5 ish cm hemorrhagic endometioma and my left ovary/ tube, which it was on. The surgeon also unstuck both ovaries from my abdominal wall.\n\nI woke up from surgery, feeling much less pressure on my organs, but much more pain elsewhere. I suddenly had pain between my vagina and anus, which radiated up into my tailbone. It's never stopped. I live at a daily 6, 5 on a really good day, out of 10 on the pain scale. My doctor's are finally listening to me, and I've got appts and tests on the books. But I've been struggling to manage my pain. I'll post what has and hasn't helped, but recently discovered acupuncture. \n\nIt's made a profound difference in my pain, and I've only had 2 appointments. Unfortunately, my insurance is out of network, (yay HMOs and the US healthcare system! \ud83d\ude44 /s) so it's all out of pocket, but worth every cent. The needles didn't hurt and I even got some hooked up to electrical stimulation! It was like a deeper TENS unit, it's absolutely wonderful. \n\nDuring the treatment, my pain was cut in half the first time and completely gone most of the second time. Yup. Today was my second appt and I felt like I was floating during treatment. I cried a couple happy tears. I also fell asleep a little, both times. Yo, I can't even fall asleep in my own bed! Once it's over and I stand up, the pain returns, but both times, at a 3, instead of a 6. The last treatment gave me the 3 days following, some of the most pain-lessened, energetic and happy days, I've had in a very long time. After that, the pain slowly returned, day by day. But I feel even better after treatment again today, so I'm hoping to get 4 good days out of this one. \n\nIt was not cheap, $145 first visit, $95 each after. Though where I go has packages; I bought 6 visits for $510. I'm going to try and submit the bills to my insurance and see if I can get reimbursed, as well. My husband and I have reached a point, where getting my health in order comes before all. I was about at a point where I didn't know if I could work much longer, or even drive. It broke my heart. This is 100% worth that money to me.\n\nI know this won't cure anything, but it does reduce inflammation and can help relax tense muscles over time. Plus, it keeps my pain manageable until I can get in with a different specialist in February, and hopefully more surgery soon after. If you can spare the money for 2 appointments, or think your insurance might cover it, just try it. It can't hurt.\n\nI also use (and like): baclofen, baclofen suppositories, cbd suppositories, cannabis, gabapentin, tramadol, kratom (not with the tramadol!), heated blanket \n\nI have not had luck with paxil for my pain (or mood), or ketorolac/torodol. NSAIDS in general cause agony on my stomach. Tylenol does nothing. I did 8 months of pelvic floor PT that helped to a point, and will begin seeing a pelvic pain specialist in February, as well. \n\nLove you all much and I hope you all have less pain tonight. \u2764\ufe0f","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/kwzpde/acupuncture_is_amazing/","_input_hash":662489011,"_task_hash":845255195,"options":[{"id":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","text":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS","text":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS","text":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"DISBELIEF","text":"DISBELIEF"},{"id":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","text":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE"},{"id":"DIAGNOSIS","text":"DIAGNOSIS"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"choice","accept":["ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","TREATMENT SYMPTOMS","PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept"}

{"id":"endometriosis_p1d0dl","text":"Today I went in for my first ever laparoscopic surgery. They diagnosed me with endo even before this because of the large endometrioma that the doctor found via trans vaginal ultrasound, but laparoscopic surgery is the only way to get a definite endo diagnosis. My pain is not made up! Thankfully, my endo was concentrated into a large cyst that attached itself to my right ovary. It was so big that you could barely see my ovary under it. Besides that, there was no other visible endo anywhere else. Good job body for making it easy for them, and for me. \n\nI woke up sore as all hell though. Was restless until my doctor gave me some actual painkillers. Motrin and Tylenol just don\u2019t do it for me. Gave me some extra for emergencies. The nurses and staff were extremely nice. Now I just feel like I did a non-stop 8 hour abs workout haha. The doctor also managed to take out most of the gas before closing me up so that I would not experience much gas pain or bloating. I\u2019m so glad he did, that was a life saver. I was extremely nauseous on the way home, but now my appetite is back in full swing and I keep asking my partner for snacks and food. I\u2019m hoping that removing this cyst will help me with my pain. I can\u2019t imagine having a day without any pain. Fingers crossed! \n\nThe nurse noticed that I was extremely nervous leading up to my procedure. I was having a mild panic attack. Chest pain, trouble breathing. She gave me extra oxygen and a relaxant medication and it calmed me down before I was wheeled into the OR. They had to stick a metal rod into my vagina and up into my uterus to help hold it up, as the uterus is actually a lot more flopped over than I realized lol. But I didn\u2019t really feel anything. I was sore in that area when I initially woke up, but now I\u2019m okay. Still bleeding, but they said that is expected. \n\nThey said it was one of the easiest lapro surgeries they\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019m so relieved that there were no complications.

{"id":"endometriosis_oo4alj","text":"Two years ago, I was diagnosed with endometriosis via laparoscopy. They were not able to remove everything because I had nodules at the junction between my bladder and left ureter. Three months after surgery, I developed bladder pain everyday after passing urine. It feels like my bladder is stuck to something and almost spasming. This has actually been worse than the initial endo pain before surgery. \n\nOver the past month, I started getting blood in my urine and more bladder pain (not triggered by urination). I did eventually go to the GP and was diagnosed with a UTI. However, they were not working and I ended up with a kidney infection. Despite finishing a new course of antibiotics, I am still seeing blood in my urine and having bladder pain. Yesterday I had an ultrasound of my urinary system and there is no evidence of stones, tumours, or cysts. \n\nThat leads me back to the fear of being gaslighted. If its not those things then maybe its because endo is growing in or near my bladder. The thing is endo doesn't show that well on scans and the last doctor I saw asked if I was sure that the blood in my urine wasn't my period. Honestly don't know what to do. The GP arranged a CT with contrast but I am not sure if there is any point going if it will make the gaslighting worse.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/oo4alj/anyone_else_have_a_fear_of_being_gaslighted_and/","_input_hash":-806698273,"_task_hash":181052067,"options":[{"id":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","text":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS","text":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS","text":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"DISBELIEF","text":"DISBELIEF"},{"id":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","text":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE"},{"id":"DIAGNOSIS","text":"DIAGNOSIS"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"choice","accept":["UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS","PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","DISBELIEF"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept"}

I deal with digestive/bowel issues constantly for the last few years and one of my daily symptoms is the feeling of having to go but nothing coming out/having a really hard time passing gas or stool. It feels like there's a lot of pressure from something about the size of a large marble pressing on the inside of my anus and the feeling can come and go. When all my other symptoms are really bad, the feeling is very prominent. When I used go be sexually active the pressure was very intense and I felt like I was going to poop myself. \n\nHeres the TMI part. Like super TMI. Im so sorry \ud83d\ude29 I have been experiencing constipation from hell over the last month. I have experienced constipation like this many times before. Im talking like pebble poops, mucus, not going for 2-3 days etc. With exams coming up my symptoms have overall been pretty bad so naturally the marble in my ass feeling has been there. My first thought was an obstruction but in a fit of mania/panic/being fed up with having this feeling for 3 years, last night I conducted a little experiment with a hand mirror and to my horror when I bear down I can see my insides peek out. Im not talking like my rectum is falling out of me, but when I bear down to try to poop I can see my insides approach my outsides (Im assuming this is what is causing the marble feeling). \n\nThis is where I started freaking out. I have no idea what this could be. Would a prolapse show up on an ultrasound? Could it be an endo growth? Can endo cause something like this to happen? Is it a tumour?

About a year ago (augusy 2020) I went the the ER for \"lower right quad pain\" and I thought my appendix actually exploded. I was in searing pain and it wouldn't let up. After a scan and some blood work, they said I was fine. Lymphnodes in my stomach were just swollen and it would go in a few days. It's been a bit over a year now and it's still here.

{"id":"Endo_ozacla","text":"I\u2019m not sure if anyone remembers my post from last week: [Lap Pushed Earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/oso8ff/surgery_pushed_earlier_having_a_lot_of_anxiety/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) \n\nNow that I am more coherent after yesterday\u2019s surgery, I wanted to give an update. In the days leading up to my lap, I was constantly on this sub reading all sorts of posts about the procedure because it helped me feel better, and I wanted to give someone else the same comfort if I could. \n\nYesterday, I had a laparoscopy with robotic excision if any endometriosis was found. My doctor told my fianc\u00e9 she anticipated the surgery would most likely be about an hour, but I ended up with a 4 hour surgery. I remember the nurse telling me how long I was out for and thinking they had to have found something for it to take that long. \n\nI didn\u2019t get to talk to my doctor afterward but she had a discussion with my fianc\u00e9 while I was in recovery. She told him that I had endo everywhere and she emphasized to him that given the extent of it, I will need more surgeries in the future. She said endo had caused significant damage to my uterus, and she tried to just excise those portions of it since a hysterectomy had not been discussed. My fianc\u00e9 said there was so much information that he couldn\u2019t remember exactly where they found it. My post-op appointment is in two weeks, so I am sure she will go over everything then and any treatment plans. \n\nI ended up with 4 incisions: one on my belly button, one on each side of my pelvis area, and one under my rib cage on the left side. When they wheeled me into the operating room, the anesthesiologist gave me a sedative so the last thing I remember is me telling the nurses to leave their party music on. I don\u2019t remember him telling me I was going to sleep or to count down. \n\nThe next thing I remember is waking up in recovery thinking I was at home, and I turned my head to look for my fianc\u00e9. Once I processed where I was, the first words out of my mouth were, \u201cOh yeah, I had surgery!\u201d \n\nThe recovery nurse asked about my pain, and I was at a 5 or 6 so she kept giving me pain meds until I felt comfortable. It honestly didn\u2019t feel nearly as bad as my worst period. I kept apologizing to the nurse because she was trying to talk to me and I kept falling asleep. \ud83d\ude02 The same thing happened with my post-op nurse, so luckily my fianc\u00e9 was there to listen to the discharge instructions. \n\nMy doctor is an angel, because she actually let all the gas out before I woke up. I had some shoulder pain but it\u2019s gone now. The trade off to this, however, is the freaking nausea. I think the combo of the hospital giving me pain meds on an empty stomach, the anesthesia, and the dye they used made me sick. Even after Zofran and a nausea patch behind my ear, I still vomited a lot yesterday. \n\nToday, I am just really sore and tired. Nothing unexpected given yesterday\u2019s events. I\u2019m just trying to stay on top of my pain meds, move a little, and rest/sleep. I did need my fianc\u00e9 to help walk me around yesterday. \n\nOverall, I can only feel immense gratitude for my doctor, the hospital staff, and my fianc\u00e9 for the incredible care I have been receiving. Everyone has been so kind and attentive, and yesterday could not have gone smoother. While it sucks that there are more surgeries in my future and this pain in my butt (sometimes literally) condition is now a lifelong companion, I feel lighter from the answers and validation. \n\nI hope this experience helps others who are getting ready for their first lap. \u2764\ufe0f","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/ozacla/lap_recovery_update/","_input_hash":-841886967,"_task_hash":654888827,"options":[{"id":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","text":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS","text":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS","text":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"DISBELIEF","text":"DISBELIEF"},{"id":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","text":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE"},{"id":"DIAGNOSIS","text":"DIAGNOSIS"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"choice","accept":["TREATMENT SYMPTOMS","DIAGNOSIS"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept"}

{"id":"endometriosis_lns4i3","text":"Surprise cyst found 1 month after lap &amp; 2 weeks after CT scan?!!\n\nJust wanted to share my journey with you guys and see if any of you had a similar experience!\n\nSo it\u2019s been a month since my lap (stage 2 endo on pelvic walls and behind uterus and hormonal IUD inserted). I\u2019ve been bleeding and cramping for a while now (first week after lap I was fine!).\n\nI had a CT scan on 2nd February because I was having severe bowel pain and was having rectal bleeding. The doctor noted my right ovary looked bulky and he could see I was still a little swollen from my lap/IUD and that it looked all normal. (He also found I was severely constipated which was causing pain!) I did a urine test and blood test which came back all normal. I was put on painkillers that were slightly stronger than ibuprofen, and also stool softener. Bowel pain went shortly after, but was still left with pelvic pain.\n\n\nThe past 2 weeks though, the pelvic pain has gotten worse and more frequent - called my surgeon who reassured me it can take up to 6 months to heal properly and it was probably all pain from my IUD. She asked me to come so she could do a quick internal ultrasound to reassure me and make sure the IUD was still in the right place.\n\nWent in today and although the IUD was in the right place, she found a 4cm blood filled cyst on my left ovary that wasn\u2019t their in surgery or in the CT scan. I was just shocked that something could grow that quickly in 2 weeks!!!\n\nShe\u2019s given me a course of hormonal tablets to take that should stop my bleeding, then induce a heavy bleed at the end of the course. She said that should get rid of it but has booked a follow up on 5 weeks time.\n\nShe also said my ovaries are naturally quite \u201cbulky\u201d and there was a very tiny small cyst on my right ovary during surgery (never mentioned that before...) what does a bulky ovary even mean!?\n\nI got home and napped because I was so wiped out, but later on got the most extreme abdominal pain I\u2019ve ever had in my life. I was so close to going to A&amp;E but I waited it out for 20 mins and it eased. I think it might have been to do with being prodded around inside by the internal ultrasound.\n\nAnyone else discovered a surprise cyst so soon after a lap/scan?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/lns4i3/cyst_found_on_ovary_shortly_after_laparoscopy/","_input_hash":838389832,"_task_hash":1139947858,"options":[{"id":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","text":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS","text":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS","text":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"DISBELIEF","text":"DISBELIEF"},{"id":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","text":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE"},{"id":"DIAGNOSIS","text":"DIAGNOSIS"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"choice","accept":["PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept"}
{"id":"Endo_l3x0w0","text":"I've been suffering from really bad periods since I started having them, but it took me til February last year to get the Endometriosis and Adenomyosis diagnosis. I'm 24 and can't work due to the pain.\n\nI've had my first laparoscopy in Mai 2020, however, it didn't really help with my pain at all, and afterwards I also got diagnosed with pelvic congestion syndrome. In the last few months my pain has been getting worse again, thus I went to my Obgyn for a regular check up (getting an appointment with the specialist takes time).\n\nMy Obgyn now already found another cyst as well as a lot of liquid in my abdominal area which she says is usually a sign new endometriosis is building around my uterus. My Adenomyosis also appears to have gotten worse.\n\nI was recommended to get a IUD to keep everything under control because having an operation every year isn't really an option. However, I was also told that IUD's don't always help, and due to the shape of my uterus and it no longer being super flexible it would already be super painful to get the IUD inside me.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with IUD's and Endometriosis/Adenomyosis? \n\nAlso, does anyone have any non opiate painkillers that helped them? I take 2600mg Ibuprofen and 1000mg Naproxen, as well as smoking weed, to get the pain under control but in my country you don't get opiates for Endometriosis.\n\nThank you!!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/l3x0w0/endometriosisadenomyosis_iud/","_input_hash":1127541653,"_task_hash":-1684352468,"options":[{"id":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS","text":"ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS","text":"TREATMENT SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS","text":"UNKNOWN SYMPTOMS"},{"id":"DISBELIEF","text":"DISBELIEF"},{"id":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE","text":"PERCEIVED NEGLIGENCE"},{"id":"DIAGNOSIS","text":"DIAGNOSIS"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"choice","accept":["ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept"}
